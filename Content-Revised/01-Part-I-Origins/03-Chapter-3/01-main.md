# PART I: THE ORIGINS OF CREDIT MONEY

## Chapter 3: The Sovereign's Dilemma

**Chapter Premise:** Monarchs could create credit domestically through instruments like tally sticks, but foreign wars required gold or silver that only creditors could provide. This asymmetry between domestic and international credit would drive the creation of central banks.

### The Greek Tragedy

In May 2010, Greece stood on the edge of default. The government owed €330 billion—debts it could not repay. European creditors demanded austerity: cut pensions, slash public sector wages, raise taxes. Greek citizens protested in the streets. "We can't pay!" they shouted. "Print euros!" But Greece couldn't print euros. It had surrendered that power when it joined the eurozone in 2001, trading its drachma for a currency controlled by the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.

The crisis revealed a fundamental asymmetry in monetary sovereignty. Germany could borrow at 2% interest; Greece paid 30%. Both used the same currency, but only one controlled it. Germany's debt was denominated in a currency its central bank could create; Greece's debt was denominated in a currency it had to borrow from others. This wasn't a new problem. It was the oldest problem in monetary history: the difference between domestic money you can create and foreign money you must acquire.

Edward III faced the same dilemma in 1340. He could issue tally sticks to pay English soldiers—domestic credit backed by his power to tax English subjects. But to hire German mercenaries or buy Flemish ships, he needed gold florins that only Italian bankers could provide. The distinction between domestic and international credit would drive six centuries of monetary history, from medieval defaults to modern debt crises. Understanding why requires understanding what money actually is—and why sovereignty over it matters more than any other economic power.

The royal treasury at Westminster was nearly empty. Outside, in the muddy streets of London, soldiers waited for their pay. Some had marched from Yorkshire; others had sailed from Portsmouth. All had fought for King Edward III in his war against France, and all expected coin—silver pennies stamped with the royal seal. But the Exchequer's coffers held only tally sticks and promises. The year was 1340, and England's king faced a problem that would haunt every European monarch for the next three centuries: **how to pay for war when the realm's wealth existed mostly on paper.**¹

Edward turned to the only people with liquid capital—Italian merchant-bankers. The Bardi and Peruzzi families of Florence had grown rich financing Mediterranean trade, and they understood the new instruments of credit. They advanced Edward gold florins and silver marks, recorded the debt in their ledgers, and waited for repayment. But when the king defaulted in 1345, unable to extract enough taxes from his subjects to satisfy foreign creditors, both houses collapsed. The shock rippled across Europe's financial networks. For a generation afterward, no banker would lend to an English king without collateral in hand.²

This chapter reveals a fundamental distinction that would shape monetary history for centuries: the difference between domestic credit, backed by a monarch's power to tax his subjects, and international credit, which required assets foreigners would accept. A king could create money within his realm by issuing promises redeemable in taxes. But beyond his borders, those promises meant nothing. Foreign wars required foreign credit, and foreign credit required gold, silver, or goods that could cross boundaries. The fiscal crisis of early modern monarchy was born from this asymmetry.

### The paradox of sovereignty

By the fourteenth century, European monarchs ruled territories larger and more populous than any ancient empire. Yet they were poorer in **disposable wealth** than a Mesopotamian temple or a Chinese provincial governor. The reason was structural: medieval kingship rested on feudal obligation—duties owed by vassals to lords in exchange for land—not bureaucratic extraction. A king could summon his vassals to war for forty days a year; he could collect customary dues—traditional fees and payments required by law or custom—on trade and justice; he could claim rents from royal lands. But he lacked **fiscal capacity**—the government's ability to collect taxes reliably and in sufficient quantity. He could not simply decree a tax and expect silver to flow into his treasury.³

War changed everything. The Hundred Years' War, the Italian Wars, the Wars of Religion—each conflict demanded resources on a scale that feudal dues could never provide. Cannons cost more than castles. Professional soldiers expected regular wages. Naval expeditions required not just ships but provisions, gunpowder, and foreign supplies. A single campaign could consume a decade's ordinary revenue.⁴

To finance these wars, kings needed to borrow. But **what** they borrowed, and **from whom**, determined whether they could ever repay.

### Domestic credit: the limits of tally sticks

Within England, the crown had long relied on a simple instrument: the **tally stick**. When a taxpayer delivered grain or coin to the **Exchequer**—the royal treasury and accounting office that managed all government revenues and expenditures—a clerk notched a hazel rod to record the amount, split it lengthwise, and gave half to the payer. The stick itself became a receipt—proof of payment and a claim on future tax obligations. Because the crown accepted tallies in lieu of coin, they circulated as a kind of money. A merchant who held a tally for one hundred shillings could use it to pay his own taxes or sell it to someone who owed the king.⁵

This system worked brilliantly **within the realm**. Tallies were backed by the king's power to tax, and anyone who lived under English law eventually needed to satisfy the Exchequer. A tally was as good as silver because it canceled a debt that every subject would someday owe. The crown could, in effect, spend before it taxed—issuing tallies to pay soldiers or suppliers, confident that those instruments would return through the tax system.⁶

But tallies had a fatal limitation: **they could not cross borders**. A Flemish merchant selling wool to England might accept payment in tallies if he planned to buy English goods or pay English agents. But an Italian banker financing a war in France, or a German arms dealer supplying cannons, had no use for a stick of wood redeemable only in English taxes. They demanded **coin**—gold or silver that held value anywhere.⁷

This distinction between **domestic credit** (borrowing from your own citizens in currency you control, backed by your power to tax them) and **foreign credit** (borrowing from foreigners in currencies or assets you must acquire from others) defined the fiscal crisis of early modern monarchy. At home, a king could create credit by fiat, issuing promises backed by his authority to tax. Abroad, he was just another debtor, and his word alone meant nothing.

This is exactly Greece's problem in the eurozone. Domestically, Greece could theoretically create drachmas to pay Greek workers and pensioners. But its debts are in euros—a currency it cannot create. Like Edward III needing Florentine gold, Greece needs euros from Frankfurt. Currency sovereignty determines fiscal capacity.

### What kings borrowed and why

When Edward III borrowed from the Bardi, he borrowed **gold florins**—Florentine gold coins that circulated across Europe as a trusted standard. When he defaulted in 1345, unable to extract enough taxes to repay foreign creditors, both banking houses collapsed—a **sovereign default** where a government refuses or is unable to pay its debts. When Henry VIII financed his wars against France in the 1540s, he borrowed from Antwerp bankers who advanced him **silver ducats**—Venetian gold coins used in international trade—and **bills of exchange**—merchant credit instruments allowing payment in distant cities—payable in multiple currencies. When Philip II of Spain funded his armies in the Netherlands, he pledged future revenues from American silver mines—**metal that had not yet been dug from the ground**.⁸

What were these kings buying? Not abstractions, but tangible goods and services that could only be acquired abroad:

- **Mercenaries**: Swiss pikemen, German landsknechts—professional infantry soldiers—and Italian condottieri—mercenary commanders and their troops—fought for cash, not feudal loyalty. They demanded payment in coin they could spend anywhere.
- **Warships and naval stores**: Timber from the Baltic, tar from Scandinavia, sailcloth from the Low Countries—all had to be purchased in international markets.
- **Gunpowder and weapons**: Sulfur from Sicily, saltpeter from India, bronze for cannons from German foundries.
- **Provisions for armies**: When an English army campaigned in France, it could not live off tallies. It needed bread, beer, and beef purchased locally—in French coin.⁹

Every foreign purchase required **exportable value**. A king could not pay a Venetian shipbuilder with a promise redeemable in London. He needed either **metal** (gold or silver coin), **goods** (wool, grain, or other exports), or **credit instruments** that foreign merchants would accept (bills of exchange drawn on trusted banking houses).¹⁰

This is why monarchs obsessed over their realms' supply of precious metal. Not because gold and silver were intrinsically valuable, but because they were the **universal language of international debt**. A gold coin minted in Florence could pay a soldier in Bruges, a merchant in Lisbon, or a banker in Augsburg. It was neutral collateral—a store of value that transcended political boundaries.

Today's equivalent is dollar reserves. Emerging market countries hoard dollars not because they love American currency but because international debts require payment in currencies creditors accept. Turkey's 2018 crisis, Argentina's repeated defaults—all stem from borrowing in dollars they cannot create, exactly as medieval kings borrowed gold they could not mint.

### The alchemy of coinage

If foreign creditors demanded metal, kings needed a way to concentrate it in their hands. The solution was **coinage mandates**—laws requiring that taxes, fines, and debts be paid in the king's own coin. By monopolizing the right to mint—the exclusive authority to produce official currency—and requiring its use for all obligations to the crown, a monarch could create demand for his currency even when the realm's economy ran on barter, credit, and foreign coins.¹¹

The logic was elegant: the state **spent first**, issuing coins to pay soldiers and suppliers. Those coins entered circulation, changing hands in markets and taverns. Eventually, they returned to the crown through taxes. The cycle created a perpetual demand for the king's money, because everyone who owed taxes needed to acquire it. As long as the king could enforce tax collection, his coins held value—not because of the metal content alone, but because of the **obligation** they satisfied.¹²

This was the same principle that had made Mesopotamian grain credits and Chinese jiaozi notes valuable: the issuing authority's power to demand them back. A coin was a portable tally stick, a tax credit stamped in metal. Its value derived not from the gold or silver itself but from the **legal requirement** to use it in dealings with the state.

Yet this domestic alchemy had no power abroad. A French merchant did not owe English taxes, so he had no reason to accept English coin at face value. He would take it only if the metal content justified the exchange rate—and kings, desperate for revenue, routinely debased their coinage, reducing the silver or gold and pocketing the difference. By the sixteenth century, Europe's monetary system was a chaos of clipped (edges cut off for metal), sweated (shaken to remove metal dust), and counterfeited (fake) coins, each trading at a discount to its nominal value.¹³

---

### The crisis of trust

The real problem was not metal but **credibility**. When a king borrowed, he promised to repay from future tax revenues. But could he? Medieval and early modern monarchs had no reliable bureaucracy for tax collection, no accurate census of their subjects' wealth, and no way to predict next year's harvest or trade flows. They borrowed optimistically and defaulted routinely.¹⁴

The English crown's record was particularly dismal. Edward III's default in 1345 destroyed the Bardi and Peruzzi. Henry VIII seized monastic lands to pay his debts, destabilizing the entire economy. Elizabeth I borrowed cautiously, but her successors—James I and Charles I—treated credit as an entitlement. Charles resorted to **forced loans**—loans the king demanded from merchants under threat of imprisonment—and arbitrary seizures of gold deposited at the Tower of London. When Parliament resisted his demands for new taxes, he dissolved it and ruled alone.¹⁵

The English Civil War (1642–1651) was many things—a religious conflict, a constitutional struggle, a clash of classes—but it was also a **fiscal reckoning**. Charles I's inability to finance his government without parliamentary consent revealed the bankruptcy of absolutism. When he was executed in 1649, it symbolized not just the death of a king but the death of an idea: that personal sovereignty could sustain public credit.¹⁶

Modern bond markets enforce the same discipline. When investors doubt a government's ability to collect taxes—whether Charles I's England or contemporary Argentina—they demand higher interest rates or refuse to lend entirely. Fiscal credibility requires institutional capacity, not just sovereign authority.

The restored Stuart monarchy learned nothing. In 1672, Charles II faced a liquidity crisis—shortage of readily available cash. He had borrowed heavily from London's goldsmith-bankers—men who accepted deposits from merchants and lent to the crown at interest. When the Exchequer could not meet its obligations, Charles declared the **Stop of the Exchequer**, suspending all debt payments for one year. The total suspended: **£1,328,526**—approximately **2.2-3.3% of English GDP** (Gross Domestic Product, the total value of goods and services produced) and more than the crown's entire annual peacetime revenue.¹⁷ The goldsmiths were ruined. Some never recovered; others passed losses to their depositors. The City of London's financial community resolved that the crown would never again borrow on its word alone.

Edward Backwell, one of London's leading goldsmith-bankers, learned of the Stop in January 1672. By then the crown owed him approximately £295,994—nearly his entire capital—expecting repayment from tax revenues. The interest alone would have supported his family and business for years. Instead, Charles II suspended all debt payments indefinitely. Backwell's depositors—merchants who had trusted him with their working capital—demanded their money. He could not pay them. The "one-year" moratorium was repeatedly extended, dragging on for years. Backwell continued in official service but his bank never recovered liquidity. In 1682 he was declared bankrupt. He died in exile in 1683, and only by a private Act of Parliament in 1698 could his creditors get any repayment.¹⁷ᵃ

The Stop destroyed more than individual fortunes. It shattered the trust that made credit possible. Contemporary historian Gilbert Burnet wrote that "the bankers were broken, and multitudes who had put their money in their hands were ruined."¹⁷ᵇ Most London goldsmith-bankers failed or were forced out of business in the 1670s. For a generation, merchants refused to lend to the crown except at ruinous rates or with collateral in hand. The lesson was clear: personal sovereignty—the king's word alone—could not sustain public credit. What England needed was a system where promises were backed not by royal virtue but by institutional guarantees that no single person could break.

### The circular trap

By the 1680s, England's monarchy faced a paradox that defined the age: **war required credit, but credit required trust, and trust required institutions the crown did not control**. A king could raise an army, but he could not raise the money to pay it. He could declare war, but he could not compel his subjects to finance it. And he could not borrow abroad without offering collateral—metal, goods, or credible promises—that his domestic authority could not guarantee.¹⁸

France faced the same problem. Louis XIV waged nearly continuous war from 1667 to 1714, draining the kingdom's wealth and driving it into debt. French kings borrowed from tax farmers—private financiers who paid the crown upfront for the right to collect taxes—but the system was corrupt and inefficient. Lenders demanded exorbitant interest because they knew the king might default. And when he did, as in the repudiation of debts in 1648 and 1661, it only made future borrowing more expensive.¹⁹

Spain's monarchy, despite the wealth of its American empire, declared bankruptcy in 1557, 1560, 1575, 1596, 1607, 1627, and 1647. Each default destroyed the fortunes of Genoese and German bankers who had financed Habsburg wars. Yet each time, the cycle repeated: war, borrowing, default, and a new generation of creditors willing to gamble on royal promises.²⁰

The pattern was universal. Monarchs could not wage modern war without credit. But they could not sustain credit without surrendering control over the very power—taxation—that made them sovereign. The solution, when it came, would not be a financial innovation but a **political revolution**.

### Why foreign creditors demanded gold

The distinction between domestic and foreign borrowing was not merely technical—it reflected fundamental differences in what creditors could enforce. English tally sticks worked brilliantly within England because they represented claims on specific tax revenues that domestic holders could collect. A tally reading "£9 4s 4d from Fulk Basset for the farm of Wycombe" identified both the revenue source and the tax collector.²⁰ᵃ Domestic merchants could present these tallies to Exchequer officials, verify their authenticity, and receive payment. The system required access to English institutions but no commodity backing.

Foreign creditors faced entirely different constraints. A Dutch investor holding English tally sticks could not easily collect from English tax receivers without domestic agents. He could not verify the creditworthiness of specific revenue streams. Most critically, he could not use tally sticks as payment in Amsterdam—they were worthless outside England's borders. While tallies circulated domestically as a form of money, they embodied information asymmetries that made them unsuitable for international finance.²⁰ᵇ

This explains why foreign wars required gold and silver in ways domestic finance did not. When England hired German mercenaries or purchased Dutch ships, foreign suppliers demanded payment in universally accepted media.

Gold and silver settled across borders without requiring trust in foreign legal systems or knowledge of domestic revenue collection. They avoided currency conversion risks. They provided liquid collateral that could be shipped or pledged internationally. Most importantly, they required no institutional access—a Hamburg merchant holding gold coins could spend them anywhere without navigating English Exchequer procedures.²⁰ᶜ

The mechanism of international settlement reinforced this pattern. Most cross-border trade settled through bills of exchange rather than physical gold shipments. A Virginia tobacco producer could draw a bill on his London merchant account, sell it to a local merchant, who transmitted it to London to pay for imported goods.²⁰ᵈ But bills of exchange worked only when both parties trusted the underlying banking networks. For final settlement of imbalances—when one country owed another more than it was owed—gold provided the universal medium that required no trust.

The Amsterdam Exchange Bank exemplified this system. Its "bank money" traded at a premium over circulating currency and was required by law for settling international bills of exchange. This created a two-tier system: international bills settled in Amsterdam bank money (ultimately backed by precious metal), while domestic transactions used various currencies.²⁰ᵉ During the classical gold standard era (1870-1914), gold points—the exchange rate boundaries where physical gold shipment became profitable—typically ranged from 0.4% to 1.4% of par value, depending on shipping costs, insurance, and interest forgone.²⁰ᶠ Most transactions settled within these bands through bills, but gold flowed at the margins to correct persistent imbalances.

Foreign creditors' preference for gold thus reflected practical realities rather than irrational commodity fetishism. Dutch investors who held 30.3% of Bank of England stock by 1750 did so because parliamentary guarantees made English debt credible even without gold backing.²⁰ᵍ But those same investors, when lending to Spain or France, demanded either gold collateral or interest rates high enough to compensate for default risk. The Genoese bankers who financed Spanish wars through the *asiento* system structured contracts to receive American silver directly, bypassing the Spanish crown's unreliable promises.²⁰ʰ When Spain defaulted in 1557, 1575, 1596, 1607, and 1627, the Genoese lost fortunes—but they kept lending because silver collateral made partial recovery possible.

The fundamental problem was institutional. Domestic money worked when backed by domestic tax authority. International money required either commodity backing or institutional credibility that transcended borders. England's tally sticks, France's tax receipts, Spain's promises—all were domestic instruments that foreign creditors could not enforce. Gold and silver were the only media that settled internationally without requiring trust in foreign institutions. This asymmetry would drive the creation of the Bank of England and shape monetary architecture for centuries.

### The invention of the fiscal state

What Europe needed was a way to make royal debt **credible** without relying on royal virtue. The answer emerged not from economic theory but from constitutional struggle: **parliamentary control of taxation**. If a representative body, rather than the king alone, authorized taxes and guaranteed their use for debt repayment, then creditors could trust the nation even if they distrusted the monarch.²¹

The Dutch Republic pioneered this model in the late sixteenth century. After rebelling against Spanish rule, the United Provinces created a federal system where provincial assemblies controlled taxation and borrowing. Because creditors knew that taxes were legally committed to debt service, they lent to the Dutch at interest rates far below those charged to absolute monarchs. The Dutch could borrow more, at lower cost, than any kingdom in Europe—and they used that advantage to build a commercial empire.²²

England would follow the same path, but only after a revolution. In 1688, when Parliament invited William of Orange to take the throne, it imposed a condition: the king would govern **with** Parliament, not above it. The Bill of Rights (1689) made explicit what the Civil War had implied—the crown could not raise taxes or maintain an army without parliamentary consent. That constitutional settlement transformed England's credit overnight.²³

For the first time, lenders could trust that their loans were backed not by a king's promise but by a **nation's legal obligation**. Parliament could commit future tax revenues to debt repayment, and no monarch could unilaterally repudiate that commitment. The fiscal-military state was born—a government capable of mobilizing resources on a scale that would have astonished Edward III or Charles II.

But the machinery of that state—the institution that would turn parliamentary promises into liquid credit—had yet to be invented. That innovation would come in 1694, when a group of London merchants proposed a radical solution: a bank that would lend to the government by creating money. The Bank of England would complete the revolution that began in 1688, transforming not just England's finances but the nature of money itself.

The solution to the sovereign's dilemma—how to create credible credit both domestically and internationally—would require institutional innovation on an unprecedented scale. As Part II will reveal, the answer emerged not from private ingenuity alone but from the fusion of constitutional revolution and financial engineering. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 made England's debt credible by transferring fiscal power to Parliament. The Bank of England's founding in 1694 completed this transformation by creating a mechanism to manufacture credit on demand. Together, these innovations would solve the problem that had plagued European monarchies for centuries: how to wage war without gold.

But the path to this solution would first require witnessing private money's spectacular failure. The goldsmith-bankers who emerged after Charles I's seizure of deposits in 1640 seemed to offer a solution: private institutions creating credit through fractional reserve lending, issuing receipts "payable to bearer" that circulated as currency. For three decades this system functioned—until the Stop of the Exchequer in 1672 revealed its fatal flaw. When the crown suspended debt payments, the entire network collapsed. Private money creation, however ingenious, could not provide systemic stability. The lesson would be clear: what monarchies needed was not more private bankers but a public institution backed by the full fiscal power of the state—an institution that could create money with parliamentary guarantees making its promises believable even to foreign creditors who would never accept a goldsmith's note.

And that solution illuminates today's sovereign debt crises with brutal clarity. Modern governments face the same dual money problem Edward III confronted: they can create domestic currency freely, but international creditors demand proof of fiscal capacity. When markets attack sovereign debt—Greece in 2010, Argentina in 2001, Turkey in 2018—they're demanding the same assurance medieval creditors sought: can this government actually collect taxes to repay its debts?

The distinction between domestic and international credit remains fundamental. The United States can borrow in dollars at low rates because it controls the currency in which its debt is denominated—the same advantage England had with tally sticks domestically. Japan can sustain debt exceeding 250% of GDP because it borrows in yen and controls the Bank of Japan. But countries that borrow in foreign currencies face Edward III's problem: they must acquire someone else's money to repay debts, making them vulnerable to currency crises and default spirals.

Greece's crisis wasn't caused by excessive spending—it was caused by borrowing in a currency it couldn't create. The eurozone recreated medieval Europe's problem: a monetary union without fiscal union, where member states are like medieval kingdoms—able to tax domestically but unable to create the currency their debts require. At 180% debt-to-GDP, Greece faced catastrophe. At 250%, Japan faces no crisis. The difference isn't fiscal responsibility—it's monetary sovereignty.

Edward III would recognize the dilemma immediately. The institutional solution he couldn't achieve—credible commitment backed by representative government and control over currency creation—remains the only answer. Technology changes, but the fundamental problem of making promises believable across borders endures. The lesson of 1340 still governs 2024: sovereignty over money matters more than any other economic power.

### **Chapter Summary**

Early modern monarchs faced an impossible dilemma: war required credit, but credit required trust, and royal defaults had destroyed that trust. Domestic instruments like tally sticks worked within borders because tax authority backed them, but foreign wars required gold or silver that monarchs didn't have. Repeated defaults—from Edward III to Charles II's Stop of the Exchequer—made royal borrowing ruinously expensive. The solution emerged not from economics but from constitutional revolution: parliamentary control of taxation after 1688 made England's debt credible for the first time. Lenders could trust Parliament's legal commitment even if they distrusted the king. This institutional innovation—separating borrowing authority from repayment authority—solved the credibility problem that had plagued European monarchies for centuries.
