# PART I: THE ORIGINS OF CREDIT MONEY

## Chapter 1: The Birth of Credit

**Chapter Premise:** Money began not as commodity but as credit—recorded obligations managed by institutions powerful enough to enforce them. The unit of account preceded the physical medium by millennia.

### The Bitcoin Question

When Bitcoin's anonymous creator proposed a currency with algorithmically fixed supply—21 million coins, no more, ever—the manifesto promised liberation from government manipulation. No central bank could print more. No politician could debase it. Scarcity would be absolute, enforced by mathematics rather than institutions. For millions of cryptocurrency advocates, this represented money's return to its natural form: a commodity whose value derives from scarcity itself, not from the promises of fallible authorities.

But what if this entire premise rests on a historical misunderstanding? What if money never was—and never needed to be—a scarce commodity? What if the oldest evidence shows that money began as something else entirely: not as things to be hoarded, but as relationships to be recorded?

The debate between cryptocurrency advocates and Modern Monetary Theory proponents is unwittingly reenacting an ancient argument. One side insists money must have intrinsic value, anchored in scarcity. The other argues money derives value from the institutions that issue it and the obligations it can discharge. This is not a new question. It's the oldest question in monetary history. And the answer, written in clay five thousand years ago, might surprise both sides.

The smell of barley dust filled the air inside the temple granary of Uruk. A scribe, reed stylus in hand, pressed wedge-shaped marks into a damp clay tablet. Each mark recorded a promise—how much grain a farmer owed after harvest, or what portion the temple would distribute to workers digging irrigation canals. When the scribe finished, he set the tablet aside to dry in the sun. The hardened clay became both contract and currency, a permanent memory of obligation. That scene, repeated thousands of times across the Tigris and Euphrates valleys five thousand years ago, was the beginning of money.¹

For centuries economists assumed money was born from barter—hunters trading hides for grain, shepherds for wine. But the tablets of Mesopotamia tell another story. The first "currencies" were not objects at all but **records of debt**, created and enforced by central institutions—temples, palaces, and later the state.² Those institutions measured value in a common unit—silver by weight—but few ever touched the metal. Instead, they kept running tallies of who owed what to whom. The unit of account came first; the coin arrived millennia later.³

Think of it like measuring temperature in Fahrenheit—the scale exists whether or not you have a thermometer. The shekel as a unit of measurement existed before physical shekel coins did. Temples could record "you owe 5 shekels" without anyone handling silver, just as we can say "it's 72 degrees" without touching a thermometer.

This distinction is fundamental. **Commodity money** derives its value from the material itself—a gold coin is valuable because gold is valuable, whether stamped by a king or melted into jewelry. **Credit money** derives its value from the institution that issues it and the obligations it can discharge. A clay tablet recording a debt of ten bushels has no intrinsic value; its worth comes entirely from the temple's power to enforce the claim. This difference—between value in the thing versus value in the relationship—shapes everything that follows.

### The age of sacred accounting

Temples in Sumer and Babylon functioned as economic hubs. They owned land, received tithes, issued rations, and extended credit to farmers who needed seed or tools. Hudson calls them *"palatial balance-sheet economies"*—centralized systems where temples and palaces functioned as both banks and accounting offices, tracking debts and credits across the entire society. They lent resources during planting season and reclaimed them at harvest through taxes or interest in kind. To keep society from collapsing under compound debt, rulers periodically proclaimed *amargi*—debt cancellation or "clean-slate" jubilees.⁴ Money here was not a spontaneous market medium but a **political technology of accounting and control**.

Think of a Mesopotamian temple as a community bank where your account balance existed only as marks on a clay tablet. You delivered ten bushels of barley at harvest. The priest scratched marks into wet clay: "Farmer Enlil: +10 barley." Six months later, you needed seed grain. The priest scratched: "Farmer Enlil: -3 barley." Your wealth existed not as grain sitting in a storehouse with your name on it, but as the **difference between the marks**. The temple might lend your barley to someone else while you were not using it. What mattered was not the physical grain—it was the temple's record that you had a claim. Money was born as **accounting**, not as things.

Egypt followed a similar model. Grain stored in state granaries served as both sustenance and standard of value. Taxes were payable in wheat; officials recorded deposits and withdrawals in the same units. A worker's wage, a priest's tithe, and a merchant's payment could all be expressed in *hekats* of grain even if no grain changed hands. The economy's stability depended less on metal than on bureaucracy—the scribes' ability to maintain balanced ledgers.⁵

### A mother and daughter's debt

In Year 21 of King Rīm-Sîn I of Larsa—approximately 1801 BCE—Amat-Sîn and her daughter Šāt-Sîn stood before the scribe at the temple of the goddess Gula. They needed barley. The harvest was still months away, and their stores had run low. The temple could help, but the help came with obligations.

The scribe prepared a clay tablet, pressing wedge-shaped marks into the damp surface with his reed stylus. The loan: **2 gur 22 sila of barley**—about 622 liters, roughly 465 kilograms. Enough to feed a family through the lean months and provide seed for planting. The tablet specified that this was "property of Gula" (NIĜ2.GA dGU.LA), meaning the goddess herself was the creditor. Repayment would be due in Month III—Simanu, corresponding to April-May—when the barley harvest came in.

The scribe did not need to state the interest rate. Everyone knew: **33.33 percent annually**, the standard rate for barley loans codified in the laws. If they repaid after the harvest, the debt would be 2 gur 296 sila—about 829 liters total. The contract included a joint liability clause: both women were responsible for the entire debt. If one could not pay, the other must. Three witnesses watched the transaction, including one named Apil-Enlil, and pressed their seals into the clay as authentication. The tablet was set aside to dry in the sun, then placed in the temple archive alongside thousands of others.

Amat-Sîn and Šāt-Sîn walked home with the barley. They had what they needed to survive until harvest. But the debt was real, recorded in clay, and it would be collected.

What happened next, the tablet does not say. Separate receipts would have documented repayment, but these are rarely preserved. If the harvest was good, they would deliver the barley to the temple in Simanu, and the obligation would be discharged. The tablet would remain in the archive as a closed account, a memory of a transaction completed.

But if the harvest failed? If drought or flood or locusts destroyed the crop? Then the debt would extend, with additional interest accumulating. The temple might accept partial payment and carry the balance forward. Or they might demand payment in another form: land, livestock, or labor. Debt servitude was not uncommon—family members working in the temple fields until the obligation was satisfied. The system had mechanisms for this. It needed to. Agricultural debt was the foundation of the economy, and the temple needed farmers to keep farming.

There was another possibility. If debts accumulated across the kingdom, if too many farmers faced insolvency, if social stability was threatened, the king might proclaim *andurarum*—a debt cancellation edict, a "clean slate" that wiped away agricultural debts and allowed the system to reset. This had happened before in Larsa. It would happen again. But no such edict is recorded for Year 21 of Rīm-Sîn I. For Amat-Sîn and Šāt-Sîn, the debt stood.

What this transaction reveals, 3,800 years later, is how **obligations created value** in the ancient world. The barley itself was just grain—it could be eaten, planted, or left to rot. But the tablet transformed it into something more: a unit of account, a medium of obligation, a tool of economic coordination. The temple's power to record debts, to demand repayment, to mobilize labor when grain fell short—this was what made the system work.

Money, in its earliest form, was not a thing but a **relationship of power**, recorded in clay and enforced by institutions. The goddess Gula did not personally collect the debt, of course. But invoking her name meant the temple's authority stood behind the obligation, backed ultimately by the king's power to enforce contracts and maintain order. The system worked because everyone understood this. The tablet was not just a record—it was a claim that could be enforced.

And it worked for women as well as men. Amat-Sîn and Šāt-Sîn could borrow, contract, and bear legal obligations independently. Economic agency extended beyond male household heads in Old Babylonian society. The debt was theirs, jointly and severally. The obligation was real.

The tablet survives today as Kress 83, catalog number P370944 in the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative, preserved in a private collection in Bochum, Germany. Purchased from the antiquities market, its exact findspot within Larsa is unknown. But the linguistic and prosopographic features confirm its origin. The reverse is partially damaged, leaving some witness names incomplete. Yet enough remains to reconstruct the transaction in detail—the names, the amount, the date, the terms, the witnesses, the seals.

For Amat-Sîn and Šāt-Sîn, the tablet was an obligation that shaped their lives for months, perhaps years. For us, it is a window into the origins of money—not as metal or commodity, but as credit, recorded by institutions powerful enough to enforce their claims.³ᵃ

### Credit before coin

China's earliest dynasties show the same pattern. By the first millennium BCE, the Zhou court kept elaborate registers of tribute and land rent. Paper instruments appeared by the Tang and Song eras: lightweight *jiaozi* notes redeemable in coin or goods, originally issued by merchant guilds and later monopolized by the state. The government accepted these notes for taxes, giving them legal value—proof that fiat currency long predates modern central banks.⁶

In all these societies, the essence of money was **trust**, not metal. As long as the authority that issued the credit could also collect taxes, its promises held. When that authority weakened—through war, drought, or rebellion—the notes lost value. Money's history, in other words, is inseparable from sovereignty.

This is exactly how modern central bank digital currencies work. When China's central bank issues digital yuan, its value comes not from blockchain scarcity but from the government's power to require tax payment in that currency. The technology changes; the fundamental mechanism remains unchanged from ancient Mesopotamia.

### The metallist challenge

The credit-first interpretation faces a serious intellectual challenge from the **metallist** school, which argues that money must have originated from commodity exchange. The strongest version of this argument comes from Ludwig von Mises's **Regression Theorem** (1912), which presents what appears to be a logical proof that credit money is impossible without prior commodity money.

Mises reasoned as follows: money's value today depends on people's expectation of its purchasing power tomorrow. Tomorrow's value depends on the next day's expectation, and so on. Tracing this chain backward, we eventually reach a day when the monetary commodity had only **commodity value**—when gold was valued for jewelry or silver for tableware, before either circulated as money. This, Mises argued, proves that money **must** originate from a commodity with prior use-value. It cannot emerge from government fiat or pure credit, because there would be no way to "bootstrap" the initial value.⁶ᵃ

The argument is elegant and has never been fully refuted on its own terms. Carl Menger, founder of the Austrian School, made a similar point in 1892: money emerged as "the spontaneous outcome, the unpremeditated resultant, of particular, individual efforts" as people gradually recognized certain commodities' superior "saleableness." This spontaneous-order narrative directly contradicts the state-creation theory.⁶ᵇ

The archaeological evidence from Mesopotamia admits alternative interpretations. While temple ledgers clearly recorded debts, those debts were often denominated in **silver by weight**—the shekel was originally a unit of weight, not a coin. Physical artifacts include "spiral coils of silver, lengths of which were snipped off to pay debts"—like carrying wire instead of coins, you'd snip off what you needed to pay, then weigh it. Denise Schmandt-Besserat's research on 8,162 clay tokens from the fourth millennium BCE shows each token represented "a specified quantity of a particular commodity"—suggesting commodity-based accounting rather than pure abstraction.⁶ᶜ

Metallists argue that even temple "credits" were ultimately claims on actual stored commodities, not pure abstractions. The requirement that temple notes be convertible to grain or silver means they differed fundamentally from modern fiat currency. The unit of account may have been abstract, but the settlement medium was tangible. This interpretation suggests that credit and commodity money coevolved rather than credit preceding commodity entirely.⁶ᵈ

The debate matters because it shapes how we understand money's essential nature. If **metallists** (economists who argue that money must originate from commodity value, like gold or silver) are correct, then fiat currency is a recent deviation from money's natural form—a deviation that might prove unsustainable. If **chartalists** (economists who argue money derives its value from taxation authority and state power rather than commodity backing) are correct that money originated as credit backed by institutional authority, then commodity money was merely a transitional phase, and fiat currency represents a return to money's original form.

This debate directly informs today's policy choices. When the Federal Reserve created trillions in COVID relief, critics invoked the metallist position: "You can't just print money!" But chartalists pointed to 5,000 years of history showing that governments with taxation authority can create money to mobilize unused resources, limited by productive capacity, not by gold reserves.

The evidence presented in this chapter supports the chartalist interpretation: sophisticated credit systems operated for centuries before widespread commodity money, and taxation authority—not commodity backing—drove currency acceptance. But intellectual honesty requires acknowledging the metallist challenge. The Regression Theorem identifies a real puzzle: how does purely abstract money acquire initial value? The chartalist answer—that state power to tax creates value from the start—is theoretically coherent but historically difficult to prove for the earliest monetary systems.

What the evidence does show conclusively is that once monetary systems were established, **institutional credibility mattered more than commodity backing**. Temple credits worked when temples were powerful; they failed when temples weakened. Tally sticks worked when the English crown could enforce taxation; they were worthless abroad where that power didn't reach. The pattern holds across millennia: trust in institutions, not faith in metal, determined whether money functioned.⁶ᵉ

### From temple to marketplace

As trade expanded across political boundaries, trust in any single ruler's IOU waned. A Mesopotamian merchant sending tin to Anatolia or a Greek trader buying grain in Egypt needed a medium others would accept without knowing him. Gold and silver—rare, durable, divisible—fit that role. They were *neutral collateral*, a kind of universal passport of value. Coins, first struck in Lydia around 600 BCE, stamped that neutrality with royal authority: the image of a lion or king guaranteed weight and purity. Metal money thus emerged not to replace credit but to bridge **zones of unfamiliarity**—the space between temples, cities, and empires.⁷

Within each realm, however, credit persisted. Greek city-states maintained public ledgers; Rome's *aerarium* kept accounts of taxes and expenditures; local bankers issued transfer orders recorded on wax tablets. The coexistence of credit and coin became a permanent feature of monetary life.

Modern stablecoins like USDC replicate this ancient pattern: credit instruments (blockchain tokens) backed by commodity reserves (dollar deposits) to bridge zones of unfamiliarity. The technology is new; the monetary logic is five thousand years old.

### Medieval continuities

When Rome fell, Europe's coin supply shrank, but the logic of accounting survived. Manorial economies of the early Middle Ages ran on obligations recorded in rents, tithes, and corvée labor. Most peasants paid their dues **in kind**—grain, wool, or days worked on the lord's fields. Where markets existed, they relied on memory and tally. The English Exchequer used **tally sticks** from the twelfth century onward: a notched hazel rod split lengthwise so that debtor and creditor each held a matching record. When a taxpayer delivered grain or coin to the crown, the sheriff's tally was "struck off," and the stick itself could circulate as payment to someone else. A 1290 record reads: *"Delivered to Roger of Suffolk one tally for one hundred shillings due from the sheriff of Kent."*⁸ The tally was both receipt and transferable credit—state-backed paper without paper.

By accepting these instruments for taxes, the crown gave them life. By keeping them on its books, it ensured their redemption. For ordinary people, a split stick was as good as silver because it satisfied the one debt that mattered most: what they owed the king.⁹

Yet this power had a fatal limitation: tally sticks could discharge obligations only within the realm. The distinction between domestic instruments backed by tax authority and international instruments requiring exportable value would haunt European monarchs for centuries and ultimately drive the creation of central banks.

This same distinction explains why the dollar dominates international trade while most domestic transactions use credit cards and bank transfers. Cross-border payments still require "neutral collateral"—today's equivalent of medieval gold—while domestic payments rely on institutional trust, just as tally sticks did in medieval England.

### The long arc of trust

From the clay tablets of Uruk to the gold guineas of London, money's evolution traces a single thread: the quest to make obligations transferable through time and space. In stable communities, shared faith and record-keeping suffice. Across frontiers, neutrality must be minted or guaranteed. Every monetary innovation—grain ledgers, tally sticks, coins, banknotes—solved the same problem at a new scale: **how to make promises believable beyond the circle of personal trust.**

That problem never vanished. Modern fiat currency, backed by a central bank's balance sheet and a government's taxing power, still depends on confidence. Its value endures not because of the paper or digits themselves but because citizens believe taxes can always be paid and debts enforced in that unit. The lineage is direct: today's Treasury security is yesterday's tally stick written in digital code.

Money, then, is not a thing but a **relationship**—a ledger of mutual recognition between issuer and user. Its stability has always rested on institutions capable of keeping that ledger honest. When those institutions falter, people reach for metal, foreign currency, or barter. When they function, trust alone suffices.

The birth of credit in the temples of Mesopotamia was therefore not a primitive stage on the road to coin but the first expression of a deeper truth: economies are systems of faith organized through record-keeping. From sacred accounting to sovereign finance, every regime of money has been an attempt to balance two imperatives—**the freedom to create credit** and **the need to make it credible**. That tension, first written in clay five millennia ago, still defines the world's monetary order.

And that brings us back to Bitcoin. When cryptocurrency advocates argue for algorithmic scarcity, they're essentially taking the metallist position: that money needs an anchor independent of state power. But five thousand years of evidence suggests otherwise. Even when gold circulated, its monetary value came from governments accepting it for taxes and stamping it into coins. The temples of Uruk didn't need scarce commodities to create functioning money—they needed institutional credibility and taxation authority.

Today's debates about Modern Monetary Theory, central bank digital currencies, and government spending are asking the same question those ancient temples answered: does money derive value from the material itself, or from the institution that issues it? The answer shapes everything. If money is fundamentally credit backed by taxation authority—as the historical evidence suggests—then governments that issue their own currency face different constraints than households. They can create money to mobilize unused resources, limited only by productive capacity, not by prior tax collection. This is not a radical modern insight but a recognition of how money has actually worked throughout most of human history.

The technology changes—from clay tablets to blockchain—but the fundamental question remains: do we want money systems that serve human needs flexibly, or systems constrained by arbitrary scarcity? The temples of Uruk chose flexibility. We're still debating that choice.

As we will see in the next chapter, medieval merchants would extend this logic across borders, creating international credit networks that operated independently of metal currency. Their innovations—bills of exchange, double-entry bookkeeping, clearing systems—would demonstrate that credit could function globally when backed by reputation and institutional trust. But they would also reveal the limits of private credit networks, setting the stage for the fiscal crisis that would drive the creation of central banks.

### **Chapter Summary**

Money began not as commodity but as credit—recorded obligations managed by central institutions. From Mesopotamian temple ledgers to Chinese paper notes to English tally sticks, societies created money through accounting systems backed by taxation authority. Credit preceded coin by millennia. The medium mattered less than the institutional capacity to impose and enforce obligations. This pattern—credit instruments circulating domestically based on tax authority—worked within sovereign borders but failed across them, setting up the fiscal crisis that would drive the creation of central banks.
