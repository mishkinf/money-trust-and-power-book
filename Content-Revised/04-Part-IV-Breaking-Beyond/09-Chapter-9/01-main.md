# PART IV: THE BREAKING AND BEYOND

## Chapter 9: The Interwar Catastrophe

**Chapter Premise:** Churchill's 1925 return to gold at an overvalued parity triggered deflation and the General Strike, while gold hoarding by France and the US created the Great Depression. Roosevelt's 1933 break from gold proved fiat money works when institutions are credible.

Winston Churchill stood at the dispatch box in the House of Commons on April 28, 1925, announcing Britain's return to the gold standard. The pound would once again be convertible at its pre-war parity: **$4.86 per ounce of gold**. Members cheered. The City celebrated. Britain had restored its honor, proving that the disruptions of the Great War were temporary aberrations. The pound would be "as good as gold" once more—a phrase that carried the weight of empire and the promise of stability.¹

What Churchill did not say—perhaps did not fully understand—was that the market exchange rate stood at **$4.77**. The official parity represented a **10 percent overvaluation**. British exports would become 10 percent more expensive overnight. To maintain the parity, British wages and prices would have to fall by 10 percent—a massive deflationary adjustment imposed on an economy still recovering from war. John Maynard Keynes, watching from Cambridge, understood immediately what Churchill had done. Within three months, he would publish a scathing pamphlet: *The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill*. Every prediction would come true.²

A century after Britain's first return to gold in 1821—which had caused devastating deflation and farmer insolvencies—the country was about to repeat the mistake. The gold standard that had seemed eternal before 1914 had already cracked during the Great War. The interwar attempt to restore it would fail catastrophically. By 1971, the last link between major currencies and precious metal would be severed—not through careful planning but through crisis and necessity. The final breaking would reveal what the first had hinted: gold had never been the foundation of monetary value. Trust was. And Churchill's decision would destroy that trust for millions of British workers.³

### Churchill's blunder

The problem was deceptively simple. The market exchange rate in January 1925 had been **$4.77**. The official parity of **$4.86** represented approximately **10 percent overvaluation**. British exports would be 10 percent more expensive to foreign buyers; British imports would be 10 percent cheaper. To restore competitiveness, British wages and prices would have to fall by 10 percent—a massive deflationary adjustment that would take years and destroy livelihoods.⁴

John Maynard Keynes, in a scathing pamphlet titled "The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill" (July 1925), predicted the consequences with precision:

- 10 percent reduction in export receipts
- Transfer of **£1 billion** from productive workers to rentiers (bondholders)
- Increased real burden of the National Debt by **£750 million**
- Deflation, unemployment, and social unrest³⁰

Every prediction came true. The coal industry, heavily dependent on exports, was hit first. Coal miners faced wage cuts; when they refused, mine owners locked them out. The dispute escalated into the **General Strike of 1926**—the largest industrial action in British history, with approximately **1.5-1.75 million workers** striking (roughly **7-8% of the British workforce**) in support of **1.2 million locked-out coal miners**.³¹ The overvalued pound drained gold reserves, forcing the Bank of England to maintain tight monetary policy. Unemployment remained high throughout 1925-1931.

Councillor Hugh Reynolds, a coalminer at Plean Colliery in Stirlingshire, experienced the lockout firsthand. By 1926 Reynolds was married with a wife and one young child.³¹ᵃ When mine owners demanded a 13 percent wage cut plus an extra hour per day in April 1926, Reynolds and his fellow miners refused.³¹ᵇ They had already endured years of wage stagnation—South Wales miners averaged only £2 13s 6d per week in 1925, far below the £3-4 often claimed.³¹ᶜ The lockout began May 1. The TUC called a General Strike in solidarity, but after nine days abandoned the miners, who remained locked out for seven more months—through November 1926.³¹ᵈ

Reynolds's family survived on 18 shillings worth of groceries per week—a voucher that barely fed three people.³¹ᵉ Even this meager relief was a loan: Reynolds later had to repay it at 1 shilling per week from his post-strike wages. Throughout the lockout, families survived on soup kitchens, charity, and community solidarity.³¹ᶠ Many went hungry. In November, with winter approaching and no resolution in sight, the miners were "finally starved into submission and forced to accept the owners' terms."³¹ᵍ They returned to work at the reduced wage—13 percent less than before—with an eight-hour day. Reynolds would spend the rest of his working life earning less, knowing the wage cut had nothing to do with productivity or market conditions. It was the price of Churchill's decision to value the pound's prestige over workers' livelihoods.

The lockout affected over 1.5 million workers. For families like the Reynolds, it meant months of hardship—reduced meals, unpaid rent, children going hungry. The strike was eventually broken, but the bitterness lingered. The gold standard had been restored, but at the cost of industrial peace and working-class living standards. Monetary policy, supposedly a technical matter for experts, had become a weapon in class conflict. The overvalued pound enriched bondholders and impoverished workers, redistributing wealth upward while economists debated exchange rate theory.

On September 21, 1931, Britain was forced off gold again. The experiment had lasted six years and accomplished nothing except economic hardship. Churchill later called it "the biggest blunder of my life." He should have either returned at a lower parity reflecting wartime inflation, or waited until prices adjusted naturally. Instead, he chose prestige over pragmatism—and Britain paid the price.³²

### The gold sinks

Britain's mistake was compounded by a global catastrophe: the **maldistribution of gold** in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Two countries—France and the United States—accumulated vast gold reserves while the rest of the world starved for liquidity. The result was the Great Depression.³³

France's share of world gold reserves rose from **7 percent** in 1926 to **27 percent** by 1932. By the Depression's depth, France held nearly as much gold as the United States, despite having an economy one-quarter the size. The causes were multiple: an undervalued franc (from the 1926 Poincaré stabilization), legal requirements that the Bank of France convert foreign exchange into gold, and a mandated **35 percent minimum gold cover ratio** that the Bank exceeded, reaching **80 percent** by 1932.³⁴

The United States contributed to the problem by **sterilizing** gold inflows between 1928 and 1930. When gold flowed into America, the Federal Reserve should have allowed the money supply to expand, raising prices and wages. Instead, it prevented monetary expansion, hoarding the gold while the rest of the world deflated.³⁵

Economist Douglas Irwin quantified the disaster. Between 1927 and 1932:

- World gold stock grew **24 percent**
- U.S. share increased **1 percent**
- France's share increased **24 percent**
- Rest of world: **0 percent**³⁶

By 1932, the U.S. and France held over **60 percent** of the world's monetary gold. Keynes called France a "gold sink." The phrase was apt: gold flowed in but did not circulate, trapped by legal requirements and central bank policy.³⁷

The impact on prices was devastating. Wholesale prices fell **34 percent** between 1928 and 1932. Irwin's analysis shows that U.S. and French gold hoarding explains approximately **40 percent** of this deflation. The gold standard, designed to provide stability, had become an engine of destruction.³⁸

Contemporary economists warned of the danger. Gustav Cassel, Keynes, and Allyn Young all predicted catastrophe if gold hoarding continued. They were ignored. Central bankers, trained to worship gold, could not imagine that their devotion to the metal was strangling the world economy.³⁹

### Roosevelt's revolution

On March 5, 1933, newly inaugurated President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared a **bank holiday**, closing every bank in America. The Emergency Banking Act, passed that same day, invalidated gold redemption. On April 5, Executive Order 6102 went further: it **banned private gold ownership**, requiring citizens to surrender gold coins, bullion, and certificates to the Federal Reserve by May 1. The penalty for non-compliance: **$10,000 fine** and/or **10 years imprisonment**. Only about 20-25 percent of gold was actually surrendered, but the message was clear: the gold standard was dead.⁴⁰

On January 30, 1934, the Gold Reserve Act formalized the new order:

- All monetary gold in the U.S. was **nationalized**
- The official price was set at **$35 per ounce** (from $20.67 since 1834)
- The dollar was **devalued** to 59.06 percent of its former value
- Gold redemption by Treasury and banks was **prohibited**
- Gold clauses in contracts were **abrogated**⁴¹

Critics called it default. The Supreme Court, in the *Consolidated Gold Clause Cases* (1935), narrowly upheld the government's actions. But the economic effects were undeniable: gold inflows accelerated, the money supply grew **10 percent annually** from 1933 to 1937, and GDP growth averaged over **8 percent** annually during the same period. The recovery from the Depression had begun.⁴²

Roosevelt's policies were controversial and remain so. But they demonstrated a crucial truth: **gold was not necessary for monetary stability**. What mattered was the government's ability to manage the money supply, maintain employment, and restore confidence. Gold had been a constraint, not a foundation.

### Bretton Woods: the dollar's triumph

The final act came in July 1944, as Allied forces fought across Normandy. At the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, 730 delegates from 44 nations gathered to design the postwar monetary system. The hotel, closed since 1942, had been hastily reopened for what Keynes called a "vast monkey-house" designed "so the President can say 44 nations agreed." The conference was scheduled to conclude July 19 but extended three days as delegates argued over the architecture of the postwar monetary order.⁴³

Two visions competed: John Maynard Keynes's **International Clearing Union** with a supranational currency called bancor, and Harry Dexter White's dollar-centered system backed by American gold.

**Keynes's International Clearing Union** was elegant and ambitious:

- A world central bank with supranational authority—a central bank for central banks
- **Bancor** as international currency (from "banque or"—bank gold), defined in gold but not exchangeable for it
- Quotas proportionate to trade volume, with overdraft facilities allowing potentially unlimited credit
- **Symmetrical adjustment**: countries with persistent surpluses would be penalized 5-10 percent interest on excess credits and required to appreciate currencies—a "use-it-or-lose-it" mechanism preventing creditor hoarding
- All international trade valued and cleared in bancor⁴⁴

**White's Stabilization Fund** was simpler and reflected American power:

- Fixed exchange rates: each currency pegged to the dollar within ±1 percent
- Dollar convertible to gold at **$35 per ounce**—but only for foreign central banks, not private citizens
- International Monetary Fund with finite resources ($8.5 billion, raised from White's initial $5 billion proposal)
- No penalty for surplus countries—White told the American delegation: "We have been perfectly adamant on that point. We have taken the position of absolutely no, on that."
- Primary adjustment burden on deficit countries only⁴⁵

The interwar period had proven that the gold standard was not a natural order but a political choice—one that served creditor interests at the expense of economic stability. Churchill's blunder, France's gold hoarding, and the Federal Reserve's adherence to the Real Bills Doctrine had combined to create the worst economic catastrophe in modern history. Yet Roosevelt's break from gold had also proven something crucial: fiat money could work when institutions were credible and policy was sound. The question was whether the postwar order could preserve this lesson or would attempt once again to restore gold's discipline. The next chapter examines the compromise that emerged—and why it was doomed from the start.

### Why This Matters Now

The Great Depression's lessons remain urgently relevant. When the 2008 financial crisis hit, central banks and governments faced the same choice Churchill confronted in 1925: defend financial orthodoxy or prioritize employment and output. This time, they chose differently. The Federal Reserve, ECB, and Bank of England slashed interest rates, created trillions in emergency liquidity, and abandoned gold-standard-era constraints. The result: a severe recession, but not a depression. Countries that acted most aggressively—the US with quantitative easing, China with massive fiscal stimulus—recovered fastest. Countries that prioritized austerity—Greece, Spain, Portugal—suffered depression-level unemployment.

The eurozone crisis replayed the interwar catastrophe in miniature. Like the gold standard, the euro created a monetary union without fiscal union, forcing deficit countries to deflate rather than devalue. Greece faced the same impossible choice as Britain in 1925: maintain the currency peg through wage cuts and unemployment, or break free and restore monetary sovereignty. Unlike Britain, Greece stayed in the euro, enduring a depression worse than America's in the 1930s—GDP fell 25%, youth unemployment exceeded 50%. The human cost mirrored the British coal miners' suffering: families losing homes, young people emigrating, pensioners impoverished.

Most importantly, the Depression proved that monetary constraints are political choices, not economic laws. Roosevelt's 1933 break from gold—once unthinkable—delivered 8% annual growth. Countries that left gold earlier recovered faster. The lesson: when institutions are credible, fiat money works better than commodity backing. Yet this lesson keeps being forgotten. When modern politicians claim we "can't afford" infrastructure or healthcare, they're invoking the same gold-standard mentality that caused the Depression. Understanding this history reveals that our current constraints are choices—and choices can be changed. The Depression happened because policymakers prioritized gold over people. We don't have to make that mistake again.

### **Chapter Summary**

Churchill's 1925 return to gold at $4.86 (10% above market rate of $4.77) imposed massive deflation on British workers. Coal miners faced wage cuts and a seven-month lockout, surviving on 18 shillings of groceries per week. The General Strike of 1926 involved 1.7 million workers. Meanwhile, France and the United States hoarded gold, creating the deflationary shock that triggered the Great Depression. France accumulated 28% of world gold reserves by 1932; the US held 40%. The Federal Reserve, following the Real Bills Doctrine, refused to expand credit as the economy collapsed. Nearly 9,000 banks failed; the money stock contracted by one-third. Roosevelt's 1933 break from gold—nationalizing gold, devaluing the dollar 41%, abrogating gold clauses—proved that fiat money could work if institutions were credible. GDP surged at 8% annually 1933-1937. Countries that left gold earlier recovered faster, proving the gold standard caused the Depression's depth and duration. The interwar catastrophe demonstrated that gold orthodoxy served creditor interests at the expense of economic stability, and that fiat money backed by institutional credibility could deliver superior outcomes.
