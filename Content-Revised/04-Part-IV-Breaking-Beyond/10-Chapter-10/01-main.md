# PART IV: THE BREAKING AND BEYOND

## Chapter 10: Bretton Woods and the Dollar's Triumph

**Chapter Premise:** Keynes's bancor lost to White's dollar-centered system. The Triffin dilemma made the compromise unsustainable: the world needed dollar outflows for liquidity, but persistent deficits undermined gold convertibility. Nixon's 1971 closure of the gold window ended the system.

---

### The decisive moment

The turning point came on **July 13, 1944**. A.D. Shroff of the Indian delegation questioned the meaning of "gold and gold-convertible exchange":

> "I think it is high time that the USA delegation give us a definition of gold and gold convertible exchange."

Edward Bernstein of the U.S. delegation replied:

> "Mr Chairman, it might be possible to give a definition...but it would involve a long discussion...it would be easier for this purpose to regard the United States dollar as what was intended when we speak of gold convertible exchange."

Dennis Robertson of the British delegation then proposed the text read: "payment of official gold and subscription should be expressed official holdings of gold and United States dollars."

The irony was profound. It was not the Americans who placed the dollar at the system's center but a fissure within the British Empire—India seeking protection from sterling weakness—and a British economist acknowledging that only the dollar had sufficient strength. The kid who owned the ball would indeed be captain of the team.⁴⁶

### Why bancor failed

White feared Keynes's International Clearing Union could create bancor at will, leaving the United States—the primary creditor—accumulating vast quantities of what he considered worthless paper while exporting real goods. As he wrote in August 1942:

> "There are some who believe that a universally accepted currency not redeemable in gold...is compatible with existence of national sovereignties....A little thought should, however, reveal the impracticability of any such notion."

The New York World-Telegram put it more bluntly in 1943:

> "The kid who owns the ball is usually captain and decides when and where the game will be played...Since the U.S. now owns some twenty-two billions of the world's reported twenty-eight billions of gold, we think Uncle Sam is going to be the captain of the team or there will be no game."

America held the leverage. Britain owed £1.3 billion in sterling balances to India and other colonies—debts that undermined any negotiating position. When Keynes protested an American draft in October 1943—"This is intolerable. It is yet another Talmud. We had better simply break off negotiations"—White replied: "We will try to produce something which Your Highness can understand."⁴⁷

The Americans offered compromises: increasing the Fund size to $8.5 billion, including a "scarce currency clause" allowing rationing of currencies in short supply, permitting some exchange rate flexibility for "fundamental disequilibrium," and creating the World Bank for long-term development finance. But they flatly rejected bancor itself, unlimited credit mechanisms, penalties on surplus countries, and any governance structure that would dilute American control.⁴⁸

Keynes signed the agreement in December 1944, later admitting:

> "We, all of us, had to sign, of course, before we had had a chance of reading through a clean and consecutive copy of the document. All we had seen of it was the dotted line. Our only excuse is the knowledge that our hosts had made final arrangements to throw us out of the hotel, unhouselled, disappointed, unaneled, within a few hours."⁴⁹

### The system in practice

The Bretton Woods system that emerged was not truly a gold standard but a **dollar standard** with gold as window dressing. The critical asymmetry: only foreign central banks and governments could convert dollars to gold at $35 per ounce—not private parties. This "exorbitant privilege," as French Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d'Estaing would later call it, was the system's foundation.⁵⁰

The mechanics worked smoothly at first. Countries maintained fixed exchange rates by buying or selling dollars. When imbalances emerged, the IMF provided short-term liquidity. When "fundamental disequilibrium" occurred, countries could devalue—as Britain did on **November 18, 1967**, reducing the pound from $2.80 to $2.40 (a 14.3 percent devaluation). Chancellor James Callaghan announced the decision on a Saturday evening at 9:30 PM. Prime Minister Harold Wilson's broadcast the next day—assuring citizens that "the pound here in Britain, in your pocket or purse...has been devalued"—was widely mocked, as the statement was technically false for domestic purchasing power.⁵¹

The system facilitated postwar reconstruction and enabled unprecedented trade expansion. But it contained a fatal flaw that economist Robert Triffin had identified in his 1959-60 Congressional testimony: once "outstanding dollar liabilities to the rest of the world would eventually exceed the US monetary gold stock," a "classic bank run" would occur.⁵²

---

### The Triffin dilemma quantified

The numbers told the story of a slow-motion crisis:

- **1949-50**: $24.6 billion in U.S. gold reserves (peak)
- **1958**: Overall U.S. external liabilities first exceeded gold stock
- **1962**: Liabilities to foreign officials exceeded gold reserves
- **1964**: $15.5 billion reserves versus liabilities (ratio approximately 1:1)
- **1966**: $13.2 billion reserves versus $14 billion central bank dollar holdings (ratio 0.94:1)
- **March 1968**: $10.7 billion (crisis low)
- **August 15, 1971**: Approximately $10 billion versus $80 billion foreign liabilities (ratio 0.125:1)⁵³

For the world to have enough dollars for trade and reserves, the U.S. had to run balance-of-payments deficits. But persistent deficits undermined confidence in dollar-gold convertibility. The system required the U.S. to be simultaneously strong (to maintain gold convertibility) and weak (to supply dollars to the world). The contradiction was unsustainable.

---

### The London Gold Pool: holding back the tide

The crisis came in waves. In November 1961, eight central banks formed the **London Gold Pool**, contributing 240 metric tons ($270 million) to defend the $35 per ounce price. The United States contributed 50 percent ($135 million); seven European central banks split the remainder. The Bank of England executed all transactions, selling gold when the London price approached $35.20 and buying when it weakened below $35.08.⁵⁴

For four years, the Pool worked. Between 1962 and 1965, it accumulated a cumulative surplus of $1.4 billion in purchases—the Pool was actually making money. But from 1965 to March 1968, it suffered a cumulative deficit of $3.7 billion. France withdrew in June 1967; the U.S. share rose from 50 to 60 percent. Between November 1967 and March 1968, the Pool lost nearly $3 billion in five months.⁵⁵

On March 14-15, 1968, the crisis reached its peak. The Queen declared a bank holiday to close the London gold market. On March 16-17, central bankers met in emergency session in Washington. The London Gold Pool was disbanded. In its place emerged the **two-tier gold market**: an official tier where central banks traded at $35 per ounce, and a private tier where market forces determined the price. When the private market reopened on April 1, 1968, gold traded at $38 per ounce—an 8 percent premium. By May 21, it had reached $42.60.⁵⁶

The two-tier system was a tacit admission that the Bretton Woods gold price was unsustainable. Central banks agreed to trade gold only at $35 per ounce among themselves, to supply no gold to private markets from official stocks, and to buy little or no gold from private sellers. The system limped along for three more years, but the end was inevitable.⁵⁷

---

### The Nixon Shock

By the late 1960s, the contradiction was unsustainable. The Vietnam War and Great Society programs had created large U.S. deficits. Dollars accumulated in foreign central banks, far exceeding U.S. gold reserves. France had been aggressively converting dollars to gold since de Gaulle's February 4, 1965 press conference—between 1962 and 1966, France reduced its dollar reserves by $2.8 billion, accounting for most of the $3.3 billion decline in U.S. gold stocks. Spain exchanged $60 million for gold in 1964-65, the "biggest transaction of the Franco era." The test came on **August 11, 1971**, when Britain requested a $3 billion gold transfer. Paul Volcker, then Under Secretary of the Treasury, later recalled: "If the British...were going to take gold for their dollars, it was clear the game was indeed over."⁵⁸

Four days later, on August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon appeared on television to announce that the United States would "temporarily" suspend dollar convertibility to gold. The announcement was a shock—no warning had been given to foreign governments or even to most U.S. officials. But it was also inevitable. The U.S. simply did not have enough gold to redeem all outstanding dollar claims.⁵⁹

The suspension was announced as temporary. It became permanent. By 1973, the Bretton Woods system had collapsed entirely. Major currencies began floating against each other, their values determined by market forces rather than fixed parities. For the first time in history, the world's monetary system was based entirely on **fiat currency**—money backed by nothing but government decree and public confidence.⁶⁰

The gold standard, which had dominated monetary thinking for two centuries, was dead. And remarkably, the world did not collapse. Inflation rose in the 1970s, but it was eventually controlled. Trade continued to expand. Financial markets adapted to floating exchange rates. The lesson was clear: **gold had never been necessary**. What mattered was institutional credibility, fiscal capacity, and the ability to manage monetary policy. These were human creations, not natural laws.⁶¹

### The liberation from gold

From the Bank Restriction Act of 1797 to the Nixon Shock of 1971, the story of money's evolution was a story of **institutional learning**. Each crisis revealed the same truth: gold was not the foundation of monetary value; institutions were. And institutions could function without gold—if they maintained operational capacity, if government could tax effectively and mobilize real resources, if monetary and fiscal policy coordinated to manage productive capacity rather than arbitrary monetary aggregates.⁵²

The breaking of the gold standard was not a failure but a **liberation**. It freed governments to pursue full employment, to respond to economic crises without being constrained by arbitrary metal reserves, to recognize that money was a tool for human purposes rather than a natural phenomenon to be worshipped. The transition was painful and often mismanaged. But it was necessary.⁵³

What remained was the challenge that had always existed: how to maintain money's function when it was no longer backed by commodity reserves. The answer, as Britain had discovered in 1797 and America rediscovered in 1971, lay in **institutions**—in central banks that coordinated with fiscal policy to manage real resource constraints, in governments that could tax effectively to create currency demand and mobilize productive capacity, in legal frameworks that maintained the social contract. Money was a social technology, and like all technologies, it worked when institutions served public purposes rather than arbitrary constraints.⁵⁴

The gold standard had been an accident, created by Newton's mathematics and sustained by British power. Its collapse was equally accidental, driven by war, depression, and the contradictions inherent in trying to base a growing global economy on a fixed supply of metal. What emerged from the wreckage was something more honest: money as a **human institution**, created by law and sustained by trust, serving the needs of the economy rather than constraining it. The breaking was complete. The age of fiat had begun.⁵⁵

The age of pure fiat had begun, but its architecture was still being built. How would central banks manage money creation to match productive capacity? How would governments mobilize real resources without artificial financial constraints? How would international coordination work without fixed exchange rates? These questions would shape the next half-century, as the world learned to operate a monetary system recognizing that real resources, not money itself, were the true constraint. The answers would emerge through crisis and experimentation, revealing both the flexibility and the political challenges of money freed from commodity backing.

### Why This Matters Now

The Triffin dilemma hasn't disappeared—it's just been transferred to a pure fiat system. The dollar remains the world's reserve currency, accounting for 60% of global foreign exchange reserves. This creates the same contradiction Triffin identified: the world needs dollar liquidity for trade and reserves, requiring persistent U.S. current account deficits. But those deficits create concerns about dollar stability and U.S. fiscal sustainability. China, holding over $3 trillion in dollar-denominated assets, faces the same dilemma as France in the 1960s: converting to other currencies would crash the dollar and destroy the value of their remaining holdings.

The 2008 financial crisis revealed both the power and the fragility of this system. When credit markets froze globally, only the Federal Reserve could provide the dollars the world economy needed. The Fed created $580 billion in currency swap lines with foreign central banks—essentially printing dollars for other countries to use. This demonstrated that the dollar's reserve status gives the U.S. extraordinary power: the Fed is the world's central bank by default. But it also revealed the system's vulnerability: if confidence in the dollar ever truly collapsed, there's no gold to fall back on, no automatic stabilizer. The system works entirely on institutional credibility.

Most importantly, understanding Bretton Woods' collapse reveals that our current monetary arrangements are choices, not natural laws. Nixon's decision to close the gold window was presented as temporary but became permanent because the alternative—deflation to defend gold convertibility—was politically unacceptable. The lesson: when monetary rules conflict with economic reality, the rules get changed. This applies to modern debates about central bank independence, inflation targeting, and fiscal rules. These are institutional choices that can be modified when they stop serving human needs. The gold standard died because it constrained economic growth and employment. If current monetary arrangements create similar problems—persistent unemployment, financial instability, climate inaction—they too can be changed. Money is a tool, not a master. The final breaking of the gold standard proved that conclusively.

### **Chapter Summary**

Bretton Woods (1944) attempted to restore gold's discipline while preserving fiat's flexibility. Keynes's bancor—a supranational currency with penalties for surplus countries—lost to White's dollar-centered system backed by American gold. The compromise worked for 27 years but contained the Triffin dilemma: the world needed dollar outflows for liquidity, but persistent deficits undermined gold convertibility at $35/ounce. The London Gold Pool hemorrhaged $3 billion trying to defend the price. When Britain requested a $3 billion gold transfer in August 1971, Nixon closed the gold window. The suspension announced as temporary became permanent. The system had failed not because fiat money doesn't work but because the compromise tried to preserve gold's constraint while allowing fiat's flexibility—an inherent contradiction. Countries that left gold earlier in the 1930s had recovered faster, proving gold caused economic damage rather than preventing it. The final breaking revealed what 1797 and 1933 had shown: gold was never the foundation of monetary value; institutional credibility was. Money is a human institution, created by law and sustained by trust, serving economic needs rather than constraining them.
