# PART III: THE GOLD STANDARD ERA AND ITS CONTRADICTIONS

## Chapter 8: The Great Forgetting—How Creditor Interests Manufactured Orthodoxy

**Chapter Premise:** Between 1800-1850, earlier understandings of money creation were systematically erased and replaced by gold orthodoxy serving creditor interests. Thomas Attwood and the Birmingham School understood that money was a social institution that could maintain full employment, but they were marginalized as "currency cranks." What had been explicit in 1694—that banks create money "out of nothing"—became unthinkable in respectable economics. This wasn't the discovery of truth; it was manufactured consensus.

### Why Do People Still Believe Household Budget Metaphors?

"We're broke." "The national debt is out of control." "We can't afford Medicare for All." The rhetoric dominates American political discourse. Politicians from both parties invoke household budget metaphors: governments must "tighten their belts," "live within their means," "balance the budget like a family." The metaphor seems intuitive—if households can't spend more than they earn, why should governments?

But the metaphor is false. Households must acquire currency before spending it. Governments that issue their own currency create it by spending. A household that prints its own money goes to jail for counterfeiting. A government that issues its own currency is performing its basic function. The constraints are entirely different.

Yet the household budget metaphor persists with remarkable tenacity, shaping debates about deficits, debt, and government spending despite being economically incoherent. Why? Because it was deliberately manufactured in the 1810s-1840s to serve creditor interests, then systematically embedded in economic orthodoxy through institutional power. What had been explicit in 1694—that the Bank of England created money "out of nothing"—became unthinkable in respectable economics within 150 years.

This wasn't the discovery of truth. It was manufactured consensus. Understanding how this happened—who benefited, what was erased, and why dissent was marginalized—reveals that our current monetary constraints are political choices masquerading as economic laws. The household budget metaphor isn't common sense. It's creditor-class ideology that has outlived the gold standard that supposedly justified it.

### The Man They Erased

On May 7, 1832, Thomas Attwood stood before the House of Commons making an argument that would get him dismissed as a crank. Britain's economic distress, he insisted, stemmed not from moral failing or foreign competition but from **monetary contraction**. He had watched it happen in Birmingham.

Attwood was no wild-eyed radical. Born in 1783 to a prosperous banking family, he had built a successful business manufacturing buttons and other metal goods in Birmingham—then England's industrial heart, second only to London in population and economic importance. His workers were skilled craftsmen, his business well-established, his social position secure. He was precisely the sort of respectable manufacturer whose opinion should have carried weight in Parliament.²⁷ᵃ

Yet he had seen something that respectable economists refused to acknowledge. During the deflation that followed the 1821 return to gold, Attwood watched his workers starve. Not because they were lazy or unskilled. Not because demand for Birmingham's products had vanished. But because **money had become scarce**. Prices fell, debts became unpayable, businesses failed, workers lost jobs. The productive capacity remained—the factories, the skills, the demand for goods—but the medium of exchange had contracted, and with it the entire economy.²⁷ᵇ

Attwood understood what David Ricardo and the Currency School did not: **money was not neutral**. Its quantity mattered for employment. When money contracted, real people suffered real deprivation—not because resources had disappeared but because the accounting system that coordinated economic activity had broken down. This was not a natural disaster like drought or plague. It was a **policy choice**, and it could be reversed through policy.²⁷ᶜ

He founded the Birmingham Political Union in 1829, gathering 40,000 signatures on a petition demanding monetary reform. The Duke of Wellington's government refused to consider it. In 1839, Attwood helped draft the Chartist petition—1,280,958 signatures demanding political reform including monetary expansion. Parliament rejected it 235 votes to 46. By the time Attwood died in 1856, his ideas had been thoroughly marginalized. Economic textbooks didn't mention him. The "Birmingham School" was dismissed as heresy. The forgetting was complete.²⁷ᵈ

Modern assessment recognizes that "the theories of the Birmingham School are now recognized as embryonic versions of the Keynesian economics of the 1930s." Attwood had articulated the multiplier effect, understood that unemployment represented wasted capacity not natural equilibrium, and grasped that paper money could function without gold backing if managed properly. He was right. But being right was insufficient. The creditor class needed "sound money" to protect their wealth, and they had the political power to make their interests into economic orthodoxy.²⁷ᵉ

Attwood's erasure was not accidental. It was systematic, deliberate, and successful. Understanding how it happened reveals how economic "truth" is manufactured—and whose interests it serves.

### How the Forgetting Happened: Creditor Class Interests and the Manufacture of Orthodoxy

The return to gold in 1821 was not merely a technical monetary decision—it was the culmination of a deliberate campaign to transform public understanding of government finance. Between 1800 and 1850, earlier conceptions of money creation as a governance tool were systematically replaced by the doctrine that taxes must fund government spending. This was not the discovery of economic truth. It was manufactured consensus serving specific class interests.²⁷ᵃ

The transformation served Britain's **creditor class**—bondholders, merchants, industrialists, and bankers who dominated 19th-century commercial society. After the Napoleonic Wars, Britain's National Debt had grown from £12 million in 1700 to **£850 million** by 1815—a seventy-fold increase. Historian Martin Daunton notes: "After the victory at Waterloo in 1815, consent was lost as a result of the high level of debt service which fell on producers within an unreformed political system." The creditor class, holding these bonds, needed "sound money" to protect their real returns. Inflation from paper money would erode the value of their holdings. Deflation—which the return to gold at the old parity guaranteed—would increase the real value of what they were owed.²⁷ᵇ

The creditors were not likely to support default or inflation given their own reliance on credit. They had a general concern to maintain the sanctity of credit, fearing that a loss of income might lead bondholders to default on their own obligations. The solution was establishing fiscal orthodoxy that claimed to protect taxpayers from government profligacy—while actually protecting creditors' returns. As one contemporary assessment stated: "Parliamentary control of finances works only if the government is not in a position to provide for unauthorized expenditures by increasing the circulating amount of fiat money."²⁷ᶜ

Ricardo and the **Currency School**—economists who believed money supply should be rigidly tied to gold reserves—provided intellectual justification. Ricardo's **Quantity Theory of Money**—the idea that prices rise proportionally with money supply—established that excess money issue causes inflation, a technical truth weaponized to serve creditor interests. **Say's Law**—the claim that supply creates its own demand, making general economic gluts impossible—eliminated justification for expansionary money creation during depressions. Ricardo's zero-sum growth theory suggested government money creation merely redistributed rather than created value. These weren't neutral discoveries—they were actively constructed to support specific policy conclusions.²⁷ᵈ

The **Bank Charter Act of 1844** institutionalized this new orthodoxy into law. It established 100% gold backing requirements for new Bank of England note issues and gave the Bank monopoly on note issuance. This made gold constraint automatic, removing discretion from government. Money creation must be constrained by gold reserves, not government needs. The principle that had been explicit in 1694—that the Bank created money "out of nothing"—became unthinkable in respectable economics.²⁷ᵉ

When dissenters emerged, they were systematically marginalized. **Thomas Attwood and the Birmingham School**—economists who believed money supply should adjust to economic needs rather than being constrained by gold—argued that Britain should have a paper currency not tied to gold and that government should counter depressions by increasing the money supply, proto-Keynesian insights that included formulations of the multiplier effect. Yet Attwood was dismissed as suffering from "financial monomania." Birmingham School economists were called "currency cranks" and "crude inflationists." Despite presenting a petition with 40,000 signatures in 1829, the Duke of Wellington's government refused to consider Attwood's proposal. His 1839 Chartist petition with 1,280,958 signatures was rejected by 235 votes to 46.²⁷ᶠ

Modern assessment recognizes "the theories of the Birmingham School are now recognized as embryonic versions of the Keynesian economics of the 1930s." But in their time, maintaining fiscal orthodoxy was more important than economic accuracy. As Ludwig von Mises later summarized the ideology: "Sound money meant a metallic standard... devised as an instrument for the protection of civil liberties against despotic inroads on the part of governments." The rhetoric was about liberty. The reality was about protecting creditor wealth.²⁷ᵍ

### Who benefited from gold standard orthodoxy

The distributional consequences of the new monetary orthodoxy were not accidental but fundamental to its design. **Creditors gained systematically while debtors, workers, and productive entrepreneurs lost**—a wealth transfer that orthodox economics presented as natural economic law.

Consider the mechanics: A creditor who lent £1,000 at 5 percent interest in 1820 expected to receive £1,050 in 1821. Under the gold standard's deflationary pressure (recall Chapter 7's analysis—the 1821 return to gold caused prices to fall approximately 20 percent by 1824), that £1,050 bought **25 percent more goods** in 1824 than the original £1,000 had bought in 1820. The creditor received not just the contracted 5 percent interest but an additional 20 percent real return through deflation. This wasn't a side effect; it was the core feature. Gold standard advocates explicitly justified the system by claiming it protected creditors' "legitimate expectations" against inflation that would erode bond values.²⁷ᵍ⁻¹

Meanwhile, **debtors suffered the mirror image**. A farmer who borrowed £1,000 in 1820 to expand his acreage now owed £1,050 in 1821—but prices for his wheat, wool, and livestock had fallen 20 percent. He needed to produce and sell 25 percent more output to repay the same nominal debt. His real debt burden increased dramatically through no fault of his own. The 1821-1824 foreclosure wave documented in Chapter 7—farmers losing land they had worked for generations—wasn't due to poor management or bad harvests but to monetary policy that systematically advantaged creditors over productive workers.²⁷ᵍ⁻²

**Workers faced a different but equally systematic disadvantage**. While prices fell during deflation, nominal wages proved "sticky"—resistant to downward adjustment because workers fought wage cuts through strikes, slowdowns, and social pressure. This wage rigidity, often portrayed as worker irrationality, was actually rational resistance to bearing the full cost of deflationary adjustment. But the result was unemployment. Employers facing falling prices but rigid wages laid off workers rather than cut wages. The 1825-1826 banking crisis, following the 1821 return to gold, saw unemployment spike as businesses contracted. Those who kept jobs maintained nominal wages but faced lower living standards; those who lost jobs faced catastrophe. In both cases, workers bore adjustment costs that gold standard orthodoxy imposed.²⁷ᵍ⁻³

The **wealth transfer was enormous and sustained**. British government debt stood at approximately £800 million in 1820—roughly 200 percent of GDP. The 1821 return to gold increased the real value of this debt by approximately 20 percent through deflation over the next few years, transferring wealth worth perhaps £160 million (£10-12 billion in modern terms) from taxpayers to bondholders. This wasn't wealth creation but redistribution: productive workers paid higher real taxes to service debt whose real value had increased through monetary policy. The bondholders—predominantly landed aristocracy, wealthy merchants, and financial institutions—saw their portfolios appreciate through government policy while claiming this was merely "sound money" protecting against inflation.²⁷ᵍ⁻⁴

Compare this to the alternative that Thomas Attwood and the Birmingham School proposed: maintain the paper currency established during the Bank Restriction (1797-1821), allow prices to stabilize at their current level, and adjust money supply to economic needs rather than gold constraints. Under this system, existing debts would have been repaid at their contracted rates without the deflationary wealth transfer. Workers would have faced neither wage cuts nor unemployment spikes. The government debt burden would have remained at its nominal level rather than increasing in real terms. Creditors would have received exactly what they contracted for—5 percent interest—but not the additional 15-20 percent windfall from deflation.²⁷ᵍ⁻⁵

**The orthodoxy's rhetoric obscured these distributional effects.** Ricardo's Quantity Theory framed inflation as universally harmful, ignoring that mild inflation transfers wealth from creditors to debtors and productive entrepreneurs while deflation does the reverse. Say's Law claimed general gluts were impossible, denying that monetary contraction could cause systemic unemployment. The Currency School's focus on "automatic" gold adjustment portrayed the wealth transfer as natural market correction rather than policy choice. When workers resisted wage cuts or debtors defaulted on loans whose real burden had doubled, orthodox economics blamed their moral failings—laziness, improvidence, speculation—rather than recognizing that monetary policy had systematically disadvantaged them.²⁷ᵍ⁻⁶

The Bank Charter Act of 1844 institutionalized this distribution into law, making creditor interests automatic through gold constraints while presenting this as neutral monetary management. The marginalizing of Attwood and the Birmingham School wasn't about technical economics—their analysis proved more accurate than Ricardo's in predicting depression and unemployment. It was about power: maintaining a system that transferred wealth upward while claiming this transfer was natural economic law. Understanding this history is essential for recognizing similar rhetoric in modern fiscal debates, where "sound money" and "fiscal discipline" continue to serve distributional ends while claiming technical neutrality.²⁷ᵍ⁻⁷

### Peel's unintended consequence: The birth of modern banking

The Bank Charter Act of 1844 represents one of history's great unintended consequences. Robert Peel and the Currency School economists crafted legislation to end fractional reserve banking and establish 100% gold backing for new note issuance. They succeeded in destroying private note issuance. They utterly failed to control credit creation. The Act **prohibited new banks from issuing notes** anywhere in Britain, froze existing country banks' issuance at 1844 levels, and mandated that banks would **lose note-issuing rights upon merger**. Combined with the requirement that new Bank of England notes be backed 100% by gold (above a £14 million fiduciary issue), Peel believed he had ended monetary inflation caused by excessive bank credit.²⁷ʰ

The mechanism worked through economic attrition rather than direct prohibition. In 1844, **277 country banks issued £8.6 million in notes** compared to £21 million from the Bank of England. Unable to expand note circulation as the economy grew, note issuance became increasingly unprofitable for country banks. When banks merged—and industrialization accelerated merger activity—note privileges lapsed and transferred to the Bank of England. By 1880, only 157 banks issued notes worth barely £6 million. By 1914, just 11 banks issued £401,719. **Fox, Fowler and Company issued the last private English banknote in 1921**, completing a 77-year transition to Bank of England monopoly.²⁷ⁱ

But the Currency School made what critics would call a "tragic error": they assumed bank deposits weren't money. They focused obsessively on paper notes while ignoring checking accounts and deposit transfers. The Act "only stopped the creation of paper bank notes—it didn't refer to other substitutes for money, such as bank deposits." Banks immediately pivoted. As monetary historian Charles Goodhart writes, "Both the Bank of England and the country banks, deprived of the right to issue notes at will, began to issue deposits to a fare-thee-well." **Fractional reserve banking didn't end in England after 1844; it simply changed to focusing on demand deposits instead of notes**.²⁷ʲ

### The intellectual blind spot: Why economists couldn't see deposits

The Currency School's error wasn't mere oversight—it reflected a profound intellectual blind spot that extended to the most brilliant economists of the Victorian era. Even those who understood banking intimately failed to grasp that deposit creation was functionally identical to note issuance. This wasn't ignorance but conceptual blindness: the inability to see that accounting entries could create money just as effectively as printing presses.

**John Stuart Mill**, writing in 1848, came tantalizingly close to the truth. In his *Principles of Political Economy*, Mill acknowledged that bank deposits operated "exactly parallel in every respect to bank notes"—he saw the similarity clearly. Yet he explicitly denied that credit could "make something out of nothing." When a bank makes a £1,000 loan by creating a £1,000 deposit, Mill argued, it hasn't created new purchasing power—it has merely redistributed existing wealth. This was precisely wrong. The loan literally creates a new deposit where none existed before. The borrower spends the £1,000, the recipient deposits it in another bank, and total deposits in the system have increased by £1,000. New money has appeared through bookkeeping alone.²⁷ᵖ

**Walter Bagehot** presents an even more striking case. His 1873 masterwork *Lombard Street* remains a classic analysis of Victorian banking, still read today for its insights into financial panic and crisis management. Bagehot understood deposit banking's practical operations better than perhaps anyone of his generation—he described how banks mobilized savings, how credit moved through the economy, how panics spread through interconnected institutions. Yet according to modern reviewers of his work, Bagehot "would reject the idea that banks create money. Banks cannot create money. They accept deposits, and then they can loan out some portion of those deposits." The man who wrote the definitive guide to deposit banking fundamentally misunderstood the core mechanism: banks don't lend out deposits, they create deposits by lending.²⁷ᵍ

The error persisted because it seemed intuitively correct. From any individual bank's perspective, it looks like intermediation: Customer A deposits £100, the bank lends £80 to Customer B, keeping £20 as reserves. But zoom out to the banking system as a whole, and the picture inverts: Customer B's loan creates a new £80 deposit somewhere in the system. Then someone deposits that £80, enabling another £64 loan, which creates another deposit, and so on. The system-level reality—money creation through lending—was invisible to observers focused on individual bank operations.²⁷ᵍᵃ

Not until **Keynes's *Treatise on Money* (1930)** do we find explicit recognition of what was actually happening. Keynes wrote: "It is evident that there is no limit to the amount of bank money which the banks can safely create provided that they move forward in step." Banks create deposits by buying assets or making loans. The money doesn't exist before the loan—the loan creates it. Yet even Keynes retreated from this clarity. His 1936 *General Theory*, the work that reshaped economics, adopted a more ambiguous treatment of money and banking. The brief moment of clarity in the *Treatise* gave way to formulations that could be interpreted as traditional intermediation. The confusion would persist for another half-century.²⁷ʳ

The full articulation awaited the Post-Keynesian revival of the 1970s-1980s. **Basil Moore's 1988 book** *Horizontalists and Verticalists* systematically explained the mechanism: "loans create deposits"—the reverse of the textbook sequence. Banks accommodate creditworthy demand for loans. When they lend, they create deposits. Central banks then supply whatever reserves banks need to settle payments between each other, setting the interest rate rather than controlling the quantity. Money supply is endogenous—determined by loan demand, not by central bank policy or reserve constraints. Moore was building on earlier Post-Keynesian work by Nicholas Kaldor and Hyman Minsky, but his 1988 synthesis finally made the argument comprehensive and irrefutable.²⁷ˢ

Why did it take so long? **The intellectual investment in the wrong model was enormous**. The "loanable funds" theory—banks as intermediaries between savers and borrowers—anchored entire edifices of economic theory. Interest rates were supposed to equilibrate saving and investment. Central banks were supposed to control money supply through reserve requirements. The money multiplier provided neat mathematical exercises for undergraduate textbooks. Admitting that banks create money by lending would require rebuilding monetary economics from the foundation.²⁷ᵗ

More profoundly, **deposit creation was invisible**. When a country bank printed a £5 note and handed it to a borrower, everyone could see new money entering circulation—a physical object that hadn't existed before now passed from hand to hand. But when a bank creates a £5 deposit by writing "+£5" in a ledger next to a customer's name, nothing physical changes. The money exists only as an accounting entry, a promise to pay on demand. Victorian economists could see notes and gold—tangible objects that seemed to obey physical laws of conservation. They couldn't see ledger entries the same way, couldn't grasp that accounting could create purchasing power as effectively as minting coins.²⁷ᵘ

This wasn't mere academic confusion—it was **the greatest regulatory failure in banking history**. Because Currency School economists didn't understand that deposits functioned identically to notes, they regulated the visible (notes) while ignoring the invisible (deposits). The 1844 Bank Charter Act meticulously controlled paper currency—100% gold backing for new Bank of England notes, frozen limits for country banks, lapsed privileges upon merger. Meanwhile, deposit banking operated completely unconstrained. No reserve requirements (until much later), no capital requirements, no limits on deposit creation. Banks simply shifted from issuing notes to creating deposits, continuing fractional reserve money creation through a new medium.²⁷ᵛ

Banks exploited this regulatory blind spot for seven decades. As note issuance became unprofitable and restricted, banks pivoted to deposits. The Scottish banks provide a telling example: after the 1845 Bank Notes (Scotland) Act capped their note circulation, they "shifted to deposits" to maintain profitability. English joint-stock banks, barred from London note issuance, built their business models around deposit creation from the start. By 1900, deposits utterly dominated the money supply—99.91% of transactions by value. The mechanism that country banks had used with notes—lending creates money, constrained only by confidence and redemption demands—simply moved underground into deposit banking, where it operated with even less oversight than note issuance had faced.²⁷ʷ

The irony compounds: while Currency School doctrine demanded 100% gold backing for notes to prevent inflation, banks were creating deposits worth many times their gold reserves—the precise "overissue" the Act was designed to prevent, just in accounting form rather than printed paper. Peel had won the battle (note control) while losing the war (credit control). The Currency School's intellectual triumph enabled the

 expansion they feared, simply by failing to recognize that the enemy had changed uniforms.²⁷ˣ

Credit creation continued unabated, now in forms the Act didn't regulate. The transformation was dramatic. In 1844, bank notes dominated the money supply. By the twentieth century, bank deposits constituted **99.91% of transactions by value**, with cash representing just 0.09%. Peel had banned visible private money while accidentally authorizing invisible private money creation on an unprecedented scale. The same mechanism that had allowed country banks to issue notes against fractional reserves now allowed all banks to create deposits through lending—but without the regulatory constraints the Act had imposed on notes.²⁷ᵏ

The United States followed a parallel trajectory. The National Banking Acts (1863-1864) imposed a **10% tax on state bank notes**, making their issuance uneconomical. State bank note circulation "fell from $143 million in 1865 to $4 million by 1867"—effectively eliminated through punitive taxation rather than direct ban. But state banks discovered the same workaround as English banks: deposits. "By the 1880s, deposit accounts had changed the primary source of revenue for many banks," and "by the 1890s, **90% of the money supply was in checking accounts**." Individual deposits grew from 5% to 23% of GDP between 1863 and 1913, with deposits rising from 96% to 592% of bank capital. State banking made a dramatic comeback through deposit creation, which faced no equivalent tax.²⁷ˡ

What emerged on both sides of the Atlantic was the modern two-tier monetary system: **central bank base money (reserves and currency) at the foundation, with commercial banks creating deposit money on top**. The Bank of England and later the Federal Reserve (1913) provided reserves—the settlement medium banks needed to clear payments with each other. Commercial banks created deposits through lending, multiplying the money supply far beyond the base. The hierarchy that had existed informally when country banks pyramided notes on Bank of England reserves was now formalized: banks needed central bank reserves for settlement, but they created most circulating money through deposit expansion.²⁷ᵐ

The Currency School's failure to understand this mechanism reveals a profound truth about money: **the form matters less than the function**. Whether money circulates as paper notes or electronic deposits, the mechanism is the same—banks create purchasing power by lending, constrained not by reserves but by demand for credit and confidence in the banking system. Peel's Act tried to control money by controlling its physical form. But money is not a thing; it is a relationship, a ledger entry, a promise. Changing the medium from notes to deposits didn't eliminate private money creation—it merely made it invisible, operating through accounting entries rather than printed paper.²⁷ⁿ

The irony is complete: the Act designed to establish state control over money creation instead **perfected private money creation** by driving it underground into deposit banking, where it would operate with even less oversight for the next century. The principle that William Paterson had articulated in 1694—that the Bank "hath benefit of interest on all moneys which it creates out of nothing"—remained true. Only now, hundreds of commercial banks were creating money out of nothing through deposit expansion, and the Currency School's legislative triumph had made this process less visible and less regulated than the note issuance it replaced.²⁷ᵒ

The transformation was complete. Within 50 years of Adam Smith's explicit statement that princes could give value to paper money through taxation, such ideas had become nearly unspeakable. The gold standard's success—its century of apparent stability from 1821 to 1914—would cement this false narrative so deeply that even its collapse in the 20th century would not fully dislodge it. The household budget metaphor, the idea that governments must "find the money" before they can spend, would persist long after the gold that supposedly justified it had disappeared from the monetary system.²⁷ʰ

### The Scottish exception: When private banking worked best

Yet amid these regulatory failures and intellectual blind spots, one region demonstrated that competitive private banking could operate with remarkable stability. **Scotland's "free banking" era (1716-1845)** remains the strongest historical example advocates cite when arguing private money doesn't need state foundation. The system endured for **129 years**, weathered multiple English banking crises with minimal disruption, and operated without a central bank monopoly, reserve requirements, or deposit insurance. If any historical case proves private money can work independently of state control, this would be it.

The system's origins were straightforward. Three chartered banks—the **Bank of Scotland** (1695), **Royal Bank of Scotland** (1727), and **British Linen Company** (1746)—dominated initially, but smaller provincial banks emerged throughout the 18th century. By 1845, nineteen banks with 363 branches operated across Scotland. Unlike England, where the 1708 Act prohibited joint-stock banking within 65 miles of London, Scottish banks could be partnerships with unlimited liability—every partner's personal wealth stood behind the bank's promises. This created powerful incentives for prudent management.²⁷ʸ

What made the system distinctive was **competitive note issuance**. Each bank printed its own banknotes, and customers could choose which bank's notes to accept. Banks met weekly for **note exchanges**—presenting each other's notes for redemption in specie—creating immediate market discipline against overissue. If Bank A printed too many notes relative to its gold reserves, competing banks would accumulate Bank A's notes and demand redemption, draining its specie. This "adverse clearing" mechanism supposedly prevented the overexpansion that plagued English country banks. Modern free banking advocates point to this as proof that competitive discipline can substitute for central bank regulation.²⁷ᶻ

The empirical record seems impressive. Scottish banking failures were remarkably rare compared to England's frequent banking panics. When England suffered the 1825-26 crisis that destroyed 71 country banks (10% of the total), Scotland experienced only three failures with limited systemic impact. The 1857 Panic that devastated English banking barely touched Scotland. Adam Smith famously praised Scottish banking in *The Wealth of Nations*, noting that despite extensive note issuance, "The business of the country is almost entirely carried on by means of the paper of those different banking companies, with which purchases and payments of all kinds are commonly made. **Silver very seldom appears except in the change of a twenty shillings bank note, and gold still seldomer**."²⁸⁰

Yet this seemingly stateless success story dissolves upon closer examination. Scottish "free" banking operated entirely **within British state frameworks**—parliamentary charters, national legal systems, and access to Bank of England facilities. The system wasn't independent of the state; it was a **state-sanctioned competitive arrangement** operating under British sovereignty.

First, **all Scottish banks required parliamentary charter or operated under British common law**. The Bank of Scotland received a charter from the Scottish Parliament in 1695—explicit state authorization. After the 1707 Act of Union merged Scottish and English parliaments, the Royal Bank of Scotland (1727) received Westminster charter, as did the British Linen Company (1746). Provincial banks operated as partnerships under British banking law, subject to the same legal frameworks as English banks—contract enforcement, property rights, bankruptcy proceedings all required state institutions.²⁸¹

Second, Scottish banks **settled ultimately in Bank of England notes and gold**—not some private commodity money independent of state systems. As the Bank of England established dominance, Scottish banks increasingly held Bank of England notes as reserves rather than purely specie. The hierarchy that existed in England—country banks depending on Bank of England notes—replicated in Scotland, just with more competitive note issuance at the second tier. Historian S.G. Checkland documents that Scottish banks held "reserves in Bank of England notes and London bills" by the mid-19th century, making them dependent on the English central banking system.²⁸²

Third, **Parliamentary regulation constrained Scottish banking**, even if less restrictively than in England. The 1765 prohibition of the "option clause" (which allowed banks to suspend redemption) was imposed by Westminster. The 1845 Bank Notes (Scotland) Act—passed by the British Parliament—capped existing banks' note issuance at 1845 levels and prohibited new banks from issuing notes. This wasn't market evolution but regulatory intervention, and notably **existing Scottish banks supported the Act** because it cartelized the market and protected incumbents from new competition. Banker James Gilbart candidly admitted: "Our rights are acknowledged—our privileges extended—and we are saved from conflicts with reckless competitors."²⁸³

The **Ayr Bank failure (1772)** reveals what happened when the system was tested. Douglas, Heron & Company, commonly called the Ayr Bank, was Scotland's largest bank, with £1.3 million in liabilities when it collapsed in June 1772. The causes were standard banking disasters: reckless lending, over-issuance of notes, speculative investments, and fraud. The bank's aggressive expansion—it operated for only three years before collapse—destabilized the entire Scottish system. Panic spread, causing runs even on sound banks. Several smaller banks failed in the cascading crisis.²⁸⁴

What prevented catastrophic systemic collapse? **State-enforced unlimited liability**. The Ayr Bank's partners were personally liable for all debts. They issued a £500,000 bond secured by £3 million in heritable estates to pay noteholders. The legal proceedings took 20-60 years to wind up as estates were liquidated and creditors paid. This wasn't market discipline—it was state-provided legal enforcement of liability through courts, bankruptcy law, and property seizures. Without British legal institutions to enforce claims and liquidate estates, noteholders would have received nothing.²⁸⁵

Even Scotland's famous stability depended on **access to Bank of England as informal lender of last resort**. During crises, Scottish banks could obtain liquidity through London correspondent banks with access to Bank of England facilities. Historian Lawrence White, a free banking advocate, acknowledges this: "Scottish banks' London correspondents had access to the Bank of England's discount window." The system worked better than England's because Scottish banks had stronger incentives (unlimited liability) and better structure (branch banking for diversification), but ultimate stability rested on connection to English central banking.²⁸⁶

The system's end confirms it wasn't purely market-driven. The 1845 Bank Notes (Scotland) Act didn't respond to market failure—Scottish banking was functioning well. Instead, **political economy** drove the change. English banking interests wanted uniformity and protection from competition. The Currency School's ideology demanded note control. Existing Scottish banks accepted the cartelization because it protected profits. The Act prohibited new note-issuing banks, capped existing circulation, and gradually brought Scotland into the Bank of England orbit. By 1914, Scottish note issuance was a vestigial privilege maintained more from tradition than economic necessity, with deposits dominating the money supply.²⁸⁷

What does Scotland actually prove? **Not that private money can exist independently of the state, but that competitive private banking can work well within state-created frameworks**. Scottish banks operated under British sovereignty, parliamentary charters, common law, and court enforcement. They settled in Bank of England notes. They had access to lender of last resort through London correspondents. When crisis came (Ayr Bank), state-enforced liability protected noteholders. The system was "free" in the sense of competitive—not free of state foundation.

The lesson is subtle but crucial: **private innovation and public foundation are complements, not substitutes**. Scotland's 129 years of successful competitive banking required the British state's legal institutions, monetary framework, and crisis backstops. It was "free banking within a state-structured arena," not banking free of the state. Modern advocates who cite Scotland as proof that cryptocurrency or private money can work without state involvement fundamentally misread the history. Even the best-functioning private banking system in history depended entirely on state-created institutions—it just had better competitive structures than England's more monopolistic arrangements.²⁸⁸

### Colonial proof: Taxation drives money through force

While 19th-century orthodoxy denied that taxation drives currency adoption, colonial administrators demonstrated this principle empirically through systematic coercion. The historical record provides the clearest evidence for the chartalist principle—precisely because colonial powers couldn't rely on market mechanisms and had to use force.²⁷ⁱ

**British colonial hut taxes** were explicitly designed to force currency adoption. The Natal Colony's 1849 hut tax eventually contributed 75% of all revenues. By the 1890s-1910s, Kenya, Uganda, Rhodesia, Gambia, Nyasaland, and Mashonaland had all implemented hut or poll taxes **payable only in colonial currency**. As documented in the Rhodesian Study Circle records: "It was variously payable in money, labour, grain or stock and benefited the colonial authorities in four related ways: it raised money; **it supported the currency; it broadened the cash economy, aiding further development; and it forced Africans to labour in the colonial economy**."²⁷ʲ

Historian Martin Daunton writes: **"Could revenue rise sufficiently unless Africans were forced into a commercialized and monetized economy that produced taxable goods and incomes to meet tax liabilities? And could crops be grown for the market, or mines developed, unless a waged labour force was created? Such considerations led to an increased reliance on the hut tax as a means of forcing economic and social change."**²⁷ᵏ

The mechanism was explicit: "Households which had survived on, and stored their wealth in cattle ranching now sent members to work for the colonialists in order to raise cash with which to pay the tax." The Hut Tax (1901) and Poll Tax (1910) in Kenya **"forced Africans into wage labor, as they needed cash to pay these levies."** This was not market-driven currency adoption—it was coercion documented in administrative records.²⁷ˡ

French colonial administrators were equally candid. Scholar Ndongo Samba Sylla documents: "African people had for a long time **resisted the imposition of the French currency**... They were aware that **the acceptance of the colonial currency would disrupt their trade and more importantly would make them economically subordinated to the diktats of their colonial masters**... **As the ban on the import of cowries and the obligation to pay taxes in the colonial currency were not always effective, colonial administrators were often obliged to use legal sanctions and physical force.**"²⁷ᵐ

The widespread resistance—the Hut Tax War (Sierra Leone, 1898), Bambatha Rebellion (South Africa, 1905), First Chimurenga (Rhodesia, 1896-97), Mau Mau Uprising (Kenya, 1952)—demonstrates these taxes' coercive nature. Currency adoption was imposed, not voluntary market-driven evolution. Lord Lugard's Political Memoranda acknowledged taxation was "a means of **educating the Africans into Anglo-Saxon virtues and economic values**"—revealing that colonial powers fully understood taxation's role in forcing currency adoption and economic transformation.²⁷ⁿ

The colonial evidence is damning. At the very moment that respectable economics in London denied that taxation drives currency demand, British administrators in Africa were proving the principle through force. The disconnect reveals the ideological nature of 19th-century monetary orthodoxy: it was not based on empirical observation but on protecting creditor interests and maintaining fiscal discipline that served the wealthy.²⁷ᵒ

The 1821 deflation had caused unnecessary suffering, destroyed livelihoods, and demonstrated that returning to gold at the old parity imposed arbitrary costs on debtors. Yet this lesson would be forgotten. A century later, Britain would repeat this mistake with even more devastating consequences—when Winston Churchill's 1925 return to gold at an overvalued parity would trigger mass unemployment, a general strike, and contribute to the global catastrophe that followed.

The gold standard era had reached its intellectual apex. What had been explicit in 1694—that the Bank of England created money "out of nothing"—was now unthinkable in respectable economics. The institutional reality of money creation had been buried beneath layers of gold fetishism and creditor-class ideology. But this very success contained the seeds of the system's destruction. The next time crisis came, the gold standard would not survive. Part IV examines how the breaking happened—and what it revealed about money's true nature.

And that manufactured orthodoxy explains why household budget metaphors still dominate policy debates 200 years after the gold standard ended. When politicians claim "we're out of money" or economists argue that deficits "crowd out" private investment, they're repeating arguments developed to serve creditor interests in the 1820s-1840s. The Real Bills Doctrine—thoroughly discredited by the Great Depression—still appears in modified form when central bankers claim they can't "print money" to finance government spending.

The Bank Charter Act's failure reveals a pattern that repeats in modern financial regulation: regulators fight the last war while banks innovate around restrictions. The Currency School tried to control note issuance, so banks shifted to creating deposits. Modern regulators focus on bank capital requirements, so finance migrates to shadow banking. The 2008 crisis demonstrated this perfectly—regulated banks were constrained, but money market funds, repo markets, and structured investment vehicles created money-like instruments outside regulatory oversight. You cannot control money creation by regulating one form while ignoring functionally equivalent alternatives.

The colonial hut tax evidence is particularly relevant. At the exact moment London economists were denying that taxation drives currency demand, British administrators in Africa were proving the principle through force. Colonial subjects resisted foreign currency until taxation made it necessary—empirical evidence that taxation creates currency demand, not the other way around. This supports Modern Monetary Theory's core insight: governments that issue their own currency don't need to collect taxes before spending. Taxes create demand for the currency, enabling government spending. The colonial administrators understood this intuitively; modern economists are still catching up.

Understanding how this orthodoxy was constructed helps us see that our current monetary constraints are political choices, not economic laws. The Currency School lost the intellectual debate but won the policy war. Their ideas, proven wrong by events, still shape how we think about money today. The household budget metaphor isn't common sense—it's creditor-class ideology that outlived the gold standard that supposedly justified it.

Yet the orthodoxy they built would face a test it could not survive: total war followed by catastrophic peace. The gold standard appeared triumphant in 1914, the foundation of international commerce and guarantor of monetary stability. But World War I would shatter gold's automatic adjustment. When Britain suspended convertibility in 1914, paper money again proved it could function without metal—just as it had during the Bank Restriction of 1797-1821. The disastrous attempt to restore gold at pre-war parities in the 1920s would vindicate every warning Thomas Attwood had made a century earlier. Churchill's 1925 return to gold would impose deflation on coal miners who had done nothing wrong except live under a monetary system serving creditor interests over human welfare. France and the United States would hoard gold, creating the deflationary shock that triggered the Great Depression. And when countries finally abandoned gold—Roosevelt in 1933, Britain in 1931—recovery would begin almost immediately. The breaking, when it came, would reveal what the gold standard's century of success had obscured: gold was never the foundation of monetary value. Trust was. And trust could be built without gold.

### **Chapter Summary**

The Bank Restriction Act of 1797 suspended gold convertibility for 24 years, proving paper money could function without metal backing if institutions were credible. Britain won the Napoleonic Wars using fiat currency, but the 1821 return to gold at pre-war parity caused devastating deflation: note circulation contracted 92%, wheat prices fell 58%, farmers faced insolvency. The Bullionist Controversy established new orthodoxy that taxes must fund spending—a radical departure from 1694 understanding. Henry Thornton's 1802 work anticipated modern monetary theory but was ignored. The Real Bills Doctrine, despite being "wholly erroneous," survived 150 years and contributed to the Great Depression. The Bank Charter Act of 1844 tried to end fractional reserve banking by controlling note issuance but failed because Currency School economists didn't understand that bank deposits function identically to notes—banks simply shifted from creating notes to creating deposits. The transformation was complete: within 50 years of Adam Smith's statement that taxation gives value to paper money, such ideas became unthinkable. Creditor class interests manufactured orthodoxy protecting their wealth through deflation. Scottish "free banking" (1716-1845) proved competitive private banking works well within state frameworks, not independently of them. Colonial hut taxes empirically demonstrated taxation drives currency adoption through force, even as London economists denied the principle. The first breaking revealed that gold was constraint, not foundation—but the lesson would be forgotten and relearned repeatedly.
