# PART III: THE GOLD STANDARD ERA AND ITS CONTRADICTIONS

## Chapter 7: Paper Proves Itself

**Chapter Premise:** The Bank Restriction Act of 1797-1821 proved that paper money could function without gold backing if institutions were credible. But the return to gold in 1821 caused devastating deflation, imposing a human cost that economists measuring price indices could not capture.

The news reached London on February 25, 1797: French troops had landed at Fishguard, Wales. The invasion force was small—fourteen hundred men, mostly convicts and irregulars—and would be captured within days. But panic spread faster than facts. By dawn on February 26, crowds gathered outside the Bank of England, demanding gold. The Bank's reserves, already depleted by years of war finance, could not withstand a sustained run. That afternoon, the Privy Council met in emergency session. By evening, they had made a decision that would have been unthinkable a generation earlier: **suspend gold convertibility**. The Bank of England, for 103 years the guarantor of sterling's value in metal, would no longer redeem its notes for coin.¹

The suspension was announced as temporary—"until six weeks after the conclusion of peace." It would last **twenty-four years**. During that time, Britain would fight and win the Napoleonic Wars, finance the largest military mobilization in its history, and prove that paper money could function without gold backing—if the institutions behind it were credible enough. The Bank Restriction Act, as it came to be known, was the first successful experiment in **fiat currency** by a major power. It worked not because of gold but despite its absence.²

### The crisis of 1797

The French landing was merely the trigger. The real crisis had been building for years. Britain's war against revolutionary France, begun in 1793, had drained the Bank's gold reserves from **£8 million** in 1791 to less than **£1 million** by February 1797. War spending, poor harvests requiring grain imports, and provincial bank runs had all contributed. By the time panic hit London, the Bank's notes in circulation—**£10,865,050**—were almost exactly **twice** its gold reserves of **£5,322,010**.³

Under normal circumstances, this would not have mattered. Most people preferred the convenience of paper to the weight of metal. But war created abnormal circumstances. Merchants needed gold to pay for foreign supplies. Investors sought safety in tangible assets. And once a run began, it fed on itself: the more people demanded gold, the more others feared the Bank would run out, prompting them to demand gold too.⁴

The Privy Council's decision to suspend convertibility was pragmatic, not principled. The alternative was worse: if the Bank exhausted its reserves, it would fail, taking the entire financial system with it. Better to preserve the institution and hope that confidence in paper could be maintained long enough to win the war and restore gold payments afterward.⁵

What happened next surprised everyone. The Bank's notes did not collapse in value. Prices rose—eventually by about **50 percent** between 1797 and 1801—but this was moderate inflation, not hyperinflation. The pound's exchange rate against foreign currencies fell, but it did not crash. And most remarkably, **people continued to accept Bank notes** for everyday transactions, even knowing they could not be redeemed for gold.⁶

### Why paper held its value

The success of the Bank Restriction Act was not inevitable. France's assignats, issued during the Revolution, had collapsed into worthlessness within five years. The American Continental dollar had suffered the same fate during the Revolutionary War. Why did British paper money succeed where others had failed?⁷

The answer lay in **institutional credibility**. The Bank of England, unlike France's revolutionary government or America's Continental Congress, had a century-long track record of prudent management. It had never defaulted, never hyperinflated, never betrayed the trust placed in it. When convertibility was suspended, the public believed it was temporary—and that belief was rational, based on the Bank's history.⁸

Several factors reinforced confidence:

**1. Merchant support**: On February 28, 1797—the day after suspension—London's leading merchants issued a public statement declaring their willingness to accept Bank notes "as readily as gold." This was not altruism but self-interest: the merchants needed the financial system to function, and that required maintaining confidence in paper.⁹

**2. Credible commitment**: The suspension was framed as temporary, "until six weeks after the conclusion of peace." This gave the public a clear endpoint and a reason to believe that gold convertibility would eventually resume. The government did not claim the power to print money indefinitely; it claimed only the necessity of suspending convertibility during wartime emergency.¹⁰

**3. Fiscal backing**: In 1798, Prime Minister William Pitt introduced Britain's first **income tax**—a direct levy on earnings that demonstrated the government's capacity to raise revenue. This was crucial: foreign creditors and domestic holders of government debt needed assurance that Britain could service its obligations. The income tax provided that assurance, showing that the state had untapped fiscal capacity.¹¹

**4. War success**: Britain ultimately won the Napoleonic Wars, validating the public's confidence. Had Britain lost, the Bank's notes would likely have collapsed. But victory vindicated the suspension, proving that the government's promises—even when not backed by gold—could be trusted.¹²

### The Bullionist Controversy: The beginning of the Great Reversal

Not everyone accepted the suspension quietly. By 1809, with prices rising and the pound's exchange rate falling, a fierce debate erupted over monetary policy. But this was more than a technical dispute about inflation—it was the opening battle in a campaign that would fundamentally transform public understanding of government finance. What began as an argument about Bank of England note issuance would end with the establishment of a new orthodoxy: that governments must tax or borrow before they can spend, that money creation threatens liberty, and that fiscal discipline requires external constraints on state power.¹³

The **Bullionists** (economists who argued that paper money must be backed by gold or silver reserves to prevent inflation), led by economist David Ricardo, argued that the Bank had issued too many notes, causing inflation and currency depreciation. The solution, they insisted, was to restore gold convertibility immediately, forcing the Bank to contract its note issue. But Ricardo's vision went beyond technical monetary management. In his 1824 "Plan for the Establishment of a National Bank," he argued that government should not issue money directly but must borrow from the Bank, paying interest—explicitly establishing the paradigm that **taxes and borrowing must fund spending**. This was a radical departure from the understanding that had prevailed when the Bank was founded in 1694, when Paterson had openly described the Bank's power to create money "out of nothing."¹³ᵃ

The **Anti-Bullionists**, including the Bank's directors and government officials, blamed external factors: poor harvests, food imports, and subsidies to continental allies. They argued that the Bank had merely accommodated the "needs of trade" by discounting legitimate commercial paper. According to the **Real Bills Doctrine**, as long as the Bank lent only against good collateral, its note issue could not cause inflation—it would simply follow the economy's real demand for money.¹⁴

In June 1810, a Parliamentary Select Committee chaired by Francis Horner issued the **Bullion Report**, siding decisively with the Bullionists. The Report blamed the Bank for not contracting note issue and rejected the Real Bills Doctrine as "wholly erroneous in principle, and pregnant with dangerous consequences in practice." It recommended restoring convertibility within two years.¹⁵

Parliament rejected the Report's recommendations by large majorities. The war was not yet won; the government needed continued access to Bank credit; and most MPs feared that a sudden contraction would cause economic hardship. The debate raged on, but policy remained unchanged—for now.¹⁶

But the Bullionists had planted a seed that would grow into the dominant economic orthodoxy of the 19th century. Their victory would come not in 1810 but in 1821, when gold convertibility was restored, and definitively in 1844, when the Bank Charter Act institutionalized their principles into law.¹⁶ᵃ

### Henry Thornton's genius

Amid the controversy, one voice stood out for its analytical clarity: **Henry Thornton**, a banker and MP who in 1802 had published *An Inquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain*. Thornton's book is arguably the most important work of monetary economics before the 20th century, anticipating insights that would not be formalized for another hundred years.¹⁷

Thornton's key contributions:

**The two-interest-rate model**: Thornton distinguished between the Bank's lending rate and the "current rate of mercantile profit." If the Bank's rate was too low relative to profit opportunities, borrowing would expand indefinitely, driving inflation. This was the foundation for all subsequent theories of the "natural rate" of interest, including Knut Wicksell's cumulative process (1898).¹⁸

**Lender of last resort**: Thornton argued that the Bank should hold large reserves and lend freely during financial panics ("internal drains"), but distinguish between temporary liquidity crises and permanent external drains that required gold outflows. This doctrine, later refined by Walter Bagehot, became the cornerstone of central banking practice.¹⁹

**Discretionary policy**: Thornton advocated flexible monetary management, recognizing that rigid rules could not account for changing circumstances. But by 1810, observing the Bank's behavior during the Restriction, he concluded that discretion needed legal constraints—the Bank could not be trusted to manage itself without external discipline.²⁰

**On deflation**: Thornton warned that "a very great and sudden reduction in the accustomed number of bank notes" would create "unusual and temporary distress" and "discouragement of the fabrication of manufactures." He understood what later economists would call the **sticky wages** problem: prices and wages do not adjust instantly to monetary contraction, so deflation causes real economic pain.²¹

**On government spending and money creation**: Thornton recognized that government spending created money directly. Francis Horner, summarizing Thornton's work, noted that "loans to Government, in their direct operation, rather contributed to repair" money shortages "because notes were issued from Exchequer almost immediately into market." This anticipated the modern understanding that government deficit spending increases the money supply—an insight that would be forgotten and rediscovered repeatedly over the next two centuries.²¹ᵃ

Thornton's work was largely ignored by his contemporaries, who preferred simpler theories. But his insights would prove prophetic when Britain finally restored gold convertibility in 1821.

### The seductive fallacy: Real Bills and its consequences

The **Real Bills Doctrine** deserves attention not as an obscure historical curiosity but because this seemingly logical theory would contribute directly to the Great Depression. Understanding why intelligent people believed it—and why it was catastrophically wrong—helps explain how monetary policy disasters happen.

The doctrine was perhaps the most dangerous economic fallacy in history, surviving for 150 years despite repeated refutations.

The doctrine originated with Adam Smith's *Wealth of Nations* (1776): banks should lend only against legitimate commercial bills backed by goods in production. Smith argued the money supply would automatically adjust to the "needs of trade" and could never cause inflation—like a self-regulating pond where outflows equaled inflows.²²

The logic seemed airtight. A merchant borrows to buy inventory. When goods sell, the loan is repaid. Money creation tied to real production, with automatic limitation. What could go wrong?

**Everything**, as Thornton demonstrated in 1802. The fatal flaw: real bills are **nominal** instruments. A bill for $1,000 of wheat at $10 per bushel represents 100 bushels. If prices double, the same 100 bushels generate a bill for $2,000. The "real bills" backing expands with the price level—providing **no constraint** on monetary expansion. It creates a positive feedback loop: more money → higher prices → larger nominal value of bills → more money creation. The doctrine promised automatic limitation but delivered unlimited expansion.²³

Thornton identified a second flaw: the doctrine ignored **interest rates**. If the Bank's lending rate remained at 5 percent while profit expectations rose to 7 percent, borrowing demand would become unlimited. Merchants would borrow not for commerce but to profit from the spread. The doctrine promised automatic limitation but delivered perpetual inflation.²⁴

The 1810 **Bullion Report** condemned the doctrine as "wholly erroneous in principle, and pregnant with dangerous consequences in practice."²⁵ Yet it survived, enshrined in the **Federal Reserve Act of 1913**: Federal Reserve Banks could discount only "notes arising out of **actual commercial transactions**"—self-liquidating paper excluding anything "speculative."²⁶

The disaster came in 1929-1933. As the Depression deepened, the Fed reasoned that stock market speculation was "speculative, not productive," and therefore should not be supported. As production fell, the "needs of trade" legitimately declined, so monetary contraction was the appropriate response. This **procyclical** policy (policy that amplifies economic cycles rather than dampening them) deepened the Depression catastrophically. Nearly 9,000 banks failed. The money stock contracted by one-third. Friedman and Schwartz later demonstrated that this monetary contraction **caused** the Great Depression—not the 1929 crash but the policy choice that followed.²⁷⁻²⁸

In 2002, Federal Reserve Governor Ben Bernanke offered an extraordinary apology at a conference honoring Milton Friedman's 90th birthday: "Regarding the Great Depression. You're right, we did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again."

The Real Bills Doctrine's appeal lay in its apparent common sense: tie money creation to real production, and inflation becomes impossible. But money is a nominal measure that interacts with the price level. The doctrine confused nominal and real values, ignored interest rates, and prescribed procyclical policy that amplified economic fluctuations. Those consequences would not be fully understood for another 130 years, when they helped destroy the world economy.²⁹

### The return to gold

The Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815 with Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo. But the Bank Restriction continued for six more years, as Parliament debated how and when to restore convertibility. The **Peel's Act** of 1819 set a phased schedule: resumption in gold ingots (not coin) beginning May 1, 1821, with full coin redemption deferred until 1823.²²

The Bank, eager to demonstrate its soundness, began voluntary partial resumption in January 1817. By May 1821—two years ahead of the legal deadline—full convertibility was restored. The pound was back on gold at its pre-1797 parity: **£3 17s 10½d per ounce** of standard gold.²³

The economic consequences were severe. To restore the pound's value, the Bank had to contract its note issue dramatically. Note circulation fell from **£28.4 million** in 1814 (backed by only **£2.2 million** in gold) to **£2.3 million** in 1821 (backed by **£11.2 million** in gold). The ratio had completely reversed.²⁴ In contemporary terms, the 1814 note circulation represented approximately **9.5% of British GDP**, while gold reserves were only **0.7%**—a note-to-gold ratio of 12.9:1. By 1821, note circulation had contracted to just **0.6% of GDP** while gold reserves rose to **3.0%**—a staggering **92% reduction** in circulating money over seven years.²⁴ᵃ

Prices collapsed. The general price index fell from **150** at the end of 1818 to **120** by early 1821 and **104** by mid-1824. Farmers, who had borrowed during the inflationary war years, found themselves repaying loans in appreciated currency—their debts had effectively increased in real terms. Industrial unemployment spiked, especially in Birmingham's metal-working trades. Contemporary Thomas Attwood declared that Peel's Act had created "more misery, more poverty, more discord, more of everything that was calamitous to the nation, except death, than Attila caused in the Roman Empire."²⁵

The human cost was staggering. Wheat prices had averaged 108 shillings per quarter in 1813; by 1822 they had collapsed to 45 shillings—a 60 percent drop.²⁵ᵃ A farmer who borrowed £500 during the war years to expand his acreage faced a debt burden that had effectively doubled in real terms. His income had been cut in half, yet his obligations remained fixed. In February 1822, MP John Gooch reported to Parliament that petitions from Suffolk showed "one unusual scene of distress" among farmers.²⁵ᵇ David Ricardo, writing from Paris in December 1821, observed that "the farmers—theirs is a pitiable situation" with no relief except "the liberality of their landlords" who were themselves "in a state of suffering."²⁵ᶜ

The London Gazette's insolvency lists tell the story in names: John Griffin, "formerly of Ogbourn St. George, farmer" in Wiltshire; John Wiltshire of Warboys, "farmer and labourer" in Huntingdonshire.²⁵ᵈ These were men who had done nothing wrong—had worked harder than ever—but monetary policy had made their debts unpayable. William Cobbett, touring southern England in late 1822, found farmers who had bought lambs for 24 shillings each and sold them two years later for 8 shillings—losses of £120 plus interest on borrowed capital.²⁵ᵉ Many tenant farmers lost their land; laborers turned to poor relief as wages fell. By May 1822, MP Matthias Attwood warned that without relief, "a great portion of the land at present under cultivation must of necessity be abandoned" with "the destruction of the farmers and labourers."²⁵ᶠ

The policy had been designed to restore Britain's "honour"—to prove that the pound's value was as solid as gold. But honour was an abstraction. For the farmers named in insolvency proceedings and the thousands more who suffered in silence, the policy was a disaster that destroyed livelihoods and families. The gold standard had been restored, but at a human cost that economists measuring price indices could not capture.

Even David Ricardo, the leading advocate of resumption, criticized the Bank for contracting too rapidly. "The evils of the time," he wrote, "arose from the Bank's not having followed his advice" for gradual reduction. The deflation was unnecessary—a policy choice, not an economic necessity.²⁶

Yet despite the short-term pain, resumption succeeded. Britain remained on the gold standard until 1914, making sterling the world's reserve currency for a century. The "honour of the country and stability of its institutions" had been restored, in the words of economic historian Frank Fetter. The gold standard had survived its first great test.²⁷

The Bank Restriction period had proven a fundamental truth: paper money could function without gold backing when institutions were credible. For 24 years, Bank of England notes circulated successfully based on taxation authority and institutional trust, not metal reserves. Yet this lesson—learned at great cost during the return to gold—would not endure. Instead, powerful interests would work systematically to erase this understanding from public memory, replacing it with an orthodoxy that served creditor interests while claiming to serve universal principles. The next chapter examines how this transformation happened—and why.

### Why This Matters Now

The manufactured orthodoxy of 1810-1821 has modern echoes. When central banks claim to be "out of ammunition" or politicians insist we "can't afford" social programs, they invoke the same fictional constraints that served creditor interests in the 19th century. The Bullionist Controversy established a paradigm—that governments must "find the money" before spending—that persists despite being historically false. The Bank of England created money "out of nothing" in 1694 and continued doing so successfully through 1821. Yet Ricardo's rhetoric made this seem irresponsible, establishing the household budget metaphor that still dominates policy debates.

The human cost of the 1821 deflation mirrors modern austerity policies. When the European Central Bank insisted on fiscal contraction during the 2010s eurozone crisis, it replayed the Bank of England's 1821 playbook: prioritize creditor interests and currency stability over employment and human welfare. Greek farmers losing their land in 2012 faced the same dynamic as English farmers in 1822—debts fixed in nominal terms while incomes collapsed. The policy was presented as economic necessity, but it was a political choice that redistributed wealth from debtors to creditors.

Most importantly, understanding the Bank Restriction period reveals that our current monetary constraints are choices, not natural laws. Paper money worked perfectly well from 1797-1821 without gold backing. Britain won the Napoleonic Wars, financed massive military expenditures, and maintained price stability—all on fiat currency backed by taxation authority and institutional credibility. When modern economists claim that government spending must be "paid for" with taxes or borrowing, they're repeating Ricardo's manufactured orthodoxy, not describing economic reality. The lesson of 1797-1821 is that money is a human institution, constrained by productive capacity and political will, not by arbitrary commodity backing. That lesson, learned at great cost, remains as relevant today as it was two centuries ago.

### **Chapter Summary**

The Bank Restriction Act of 1797-1821 was the first successful experiment in fiat currency by a major power. When French invasion panic triggered a run on the Bank of England, the Privy Council suspended gold convertibility—a suspension announced as temporary that lasted 24 years. Bank notes continued to circulate successfully because of institutional credibility: the Bank's century-long track record, merchant support, credible commitment to eventual resumption, fiscal backing through Pitt's income tax, and ultimate war victory. The Bullionist Controversy erupted in 1809, with Ricardo arguing for immediate gold resumption while establishing the paradigm that taxes must fund spending—a radical departure from the 1694 understanding that banks create money "out of nothing." Henry Thornton's 1802 work anticipated modern monetary economics, warning that rapid monetary contraction causes real economic pain through sticky wages. The Real Bills Doctrine—the fallacy that lending against commercial paper prevents inflation—would survive 150 years and contribute to the Great Depression. When gold convertibility was restored in 1821, note circulation contracted 92% over seven years, causing devastating deflation. Wheat prices fell 60%, farmers faced doubled real debt burdens, and thousands went insolvent. The human cost was staggering, but the gold standard had been restored—at a price economists measuring indices could not capture.
