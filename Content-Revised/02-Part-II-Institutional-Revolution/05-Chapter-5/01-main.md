# PART II: THE INSTITUTIONAL REVOLUTION

## Chapter 5: The Bank of England Solution

**Chapter Premise:** The Bank of England solved the credibility problem by tying its charter to parliamentary taxation, creating money through lending while maintaining gold convertibility for foreign creditors. A two-tier system emerged with country banks pyramiding on Bank of England reserves.

---

William's throne came with an immediate price: war. Louis XIV of France, Europe's most powerful monarch, refused to recognize the new regime. England, allied with the Dutch Republic and the Holy Roman Empire, was drawn into the **Nine Years' War** (1688–1697).¹⁵

The numbers were staggering. William needed **£5.5 million annually** at first, rising to **£8.5 million by war's end**—sums that dwarfed any previous English military expenditure. England's traditional revenues brought in barely half that amount. The gap had to be filled by borrowing, and borrowing required something England had never possessed: **institutional credibility**.¹⁶

Parliament's solution was elegant and unprecedented. Every loan to the government would be backed by **specific taxes**, legally earmarked for debt service. Creditors were no longer betting on the king's honesty; they were betting on Parliament's ability to collect revenue. And because Parliament represented the propertied classes—the very people who paid most taxes—it had every incentive to honor its commitments.¹⁷

This principle gave rise to what historians call the **fiscal-military state**: a government capable of borrowing vast sums at relatively low interest because its debts were secured by law, not personality. Between 1688 and 1697, England's national debt grew from nearly nothing to over **£16 million**. Yet interest rates fell, because lenders trusted the new system.¹⁸

The difference was not economic but **constitutional**. England had solved the paradox that had trapped every early modern monarchy: how to borrow without surrendering sovereignty. The answer was to surrender sovereignty—but to Parliament, not to creditors.

### The invention of the Bank

Parliamentary control solved the credibility problem, but England still needed a mechanism to turn future tax revenues into immediate purchasing power.

Yet even with parliamentary backing, England's war finance remained chaotic. Loans were negotiated piecemeal, with different creditors holding different instruments at different rates. What the government needed was a **bank**—not a private goldsmith's shop but a public corporation chartered to serve the state.¹⁹

The idea came from a group of London merchants and financiers, led by William Paterson and Michael Godfrey. Their proposal, presented to Parliament in 1694, was audacious: create a joint-stock company that would lend **£1.2 million** to the government at **8 percent interest**. In return, the company would receive a royal charter and the exclusive right to issue **banknotes**.²⁰

The scale was unprecedented. The £1.2 million loan represented approximately **2.0-2.4% of English GDP** and equaled **100% of annual government revenue**. In today's terms, this would be equivalent to roughly **$635 million to $1 billion** in purchasing power. The loan could have paid 60,000 skilled craftsmen for a year or purchased 146 small warships.²¹

The response was astonishing. The entire sum was subscribed in just **eleven days** by over **1,200 individuals**—from nobles and merchants to shopkeepers and widows. Among the subscribers was Thomas Fletcher, a Bristol wool merchant who invested £500, seeing opportunity in this new financial instrument. Yet the mechanics were more complex than they appeared. Investors did not pay the full £1.2 million immediately. Through phased capital calls, only **25 percent** was due at subscription, with another **35 percent** later in 1694. The actual cash paid in—**£720,000**—was recorded under the "Banknote" heading on the balance sheet.²²

### The alchemy of paper: How money creation worked

This is where the story gets counterintuitive. The Bank didn't lend out gold it already had—it created money by making loans.

The mechanics were revolutionary. Investors subscribed capital, and that capital was lent to the state. But the Bank would not simply hand over gold and wait for repayment. Instead, it would issue **notes**: printed promises to pay the bearer on demand. Those notes, backed by the Bank's assets (including the government loan), would enter circulation as a new form of currency.

On the Bank's ledger, the transaction looked like this:

**Assets**: Loan to Government £1.2 million  
**Liabilities**: Banknotes Issued £1.2 million

The loan was the asset; the notes were the liability. When the government spent those notes—paying soldiers, buying supplies, or funding allies—they became **money**, circulating through the economy as purchasing power. The Bank had, in effect, **created money by lending**.²³

Let's be clear about what just happened: **The Bank did not have £1.2 million in a vault**. It did not hand over someone else's deposit. It created brand new money by making two accounting entries: one recording the loan to government (what the Bank is owed) and one recording the notes issued (what the Bank owes). The notes appeared into existence through the act of lending.

This seems impossible. How can you create purchasing power from nothing? The answer is that money is not a physical thing—it's a claim, a promise, a relationship. The Bank promised to exchange its notes for gold on demand (**convertibility**—the ability to exchange paper money for precious metal at a fixed rate). But more importantly, the government promised to accept those notes for taxes. That combination—convertibility plus tax acceptability—gave the notes value.

### How Money Multiplication Works

Understanding how the Bank actually created money explains why government spending doesn't work like a household budget.

To understand how the system expanded money supply, imagine a simple sequence:

**Day 1:** The Bank lends £1,000 to government by creating £1,000 in notes
- Bank's records: "Government owes us £1,000" (asset) and "We owe note-holders £1,000" (liability)
- The notes enter circulation when government spends them

**Day 5:** Thomas Fletcher, a Bristol wool merchant receiving those notes as payment, deposits them back at the Bank
- The notes physically return to the Bank
- But the money doesn't disappear—it transforms
- Bank's records now show: "Government owes us £1,000" (asset) and "Fletcher has £1,000 deposit" (liability)

**Day 10:** The Bank lends £800 to another borrower, creating £800 in new notes
- Bank's records: "Borrower owes us £800" (asset) and "We owe note-holders £800" (liability)
- Now there's £1,800 in total money (£1,000 deposit + £800 notes) created from the original £1,000 loan

The same money exists simultaneously as: a government loan still outstanding, Fletcher's deposit, and new notes issued against that deposit. **This is not fraud**—it's how credit systems work. The Bank isn't lending Fletcher's money to the new borrower. It's creating new money by lending, using Fletcher's deposit as the reserve backing.

By the 1780s, the Bank employed approximately 300 clerks maintaining these ledgers—five times more than the Treasury. Every transaction was recorded in duplicate, creating an exhaustive paper trail. The system was laborious but revolutionary: it revealed that the same foundational money could support multiple layers of purchasing power through sequential lending and depositing.²⁴

Think of it this way: banks don't work like coat-check rooms, lending out depositors' money. They work like scoreboards. When a bank makes a loan, it creates a new deposit by writing numbers in an account. The constraint is not how much money the bank has—it is whether the borrower will repay and whether people trust the bank's numbers.

A goldsmith who accepted deposits and lent them out was merely intermediating. But a bank that issued its own notes was doing something different: it was **creating new claims** on future production, backed by the borrower's promise to repay and the government's promise to tax. Banks don't lend money; they **create it by lending**.²⁵

### Why It Worked Domestically: Taxation Creates Demand

The Bank's notes circulated in England because **everyone eventually owed the government something**. Thomas Fletcher, our Bristol wool merchant, paid customs duties on his exports. A farmer in Yorkshire paid land tax every year. A gentleman in Bath paid window tax. All these obligations could be satisfied with Bank of England notes.²⁶

This created a perpetual cycle:

1. **The government spent** Bank notes into the economy
2. **The notes circulated** through private transactions
3. **Taxation withdrew** notes from circulation
4. **The government spent again**, reinjecting the notes

The cycle was self-sustaining. The government did not need to hoard gold to create money; it needed only to **spend first and tax later**. The spending created the money; the taxation ensured demand for it.²⁷

**This reveals a fundamental inversion in public discourse.** Politicians claim "we're out of money" and "must raise taxes to afford programs." But the government creates money by spending—the Bank's notes entered circulation through government expenditure, not through prior taxation. Taxes don't fund spending; **taxes create demand for what government spends**. The constraint is not finance but real resources: inflation occurs when spending exceeds productive capacity, not when it exceeds tax revenue.²⁸

Think of it this way: if the government had to collect money before spending, where would the money come from in the first place? The government creates the money by spending it into existence. Taxes ensure that money has value by creating demand for it.

Imagine you are a farmer in 1700s England. You grow wheat, raise sheep, make your own clothes. You could live entirely without money—except for one thing: the tax collector comes every year demanding £5 in Bank of England notes. Not wheat, not sheep, not labor—specifically those paper notes. Suddenly you **need** those notes. You must sell something for notes, or work for someone who pays in notes. The government created demand for its paper by requiring you to pay taxes with it.²⁹

The principle was not new. Adam Smith had articulated it in *The Wealth of Nations* (1776), writing that "a prince, who should enact that a certain proportion of his taxes should be paid in a paper money of a certain kind, might thereby give a certain value to this paper money."³⁰

### The mechanics of permanence

The Bank's power to create money rested on an unusual feature: the government debt was never meant to be repaid.

What made this system work was not the gold in the Bank's vaults but the **permanence** of the debt. The £1.2 million loan was not a short-term advance to be repaid when taxes came in. It was a **perpetual obligation**. The government would pay 8 percent interest every year, but it would never repay the principal unless it chose to. The Bank's shareholders were not creditors waiting for their money back; they were rentiers earning a steady income from the state's promise to pay.³¹

This structure had profound implications. Because the debt was permanent, the Bank did not need to hold enough gold to redeem all its notes at once. It only needed to maintain confidence that notes were **convertible** (exchangeable for gold on demand)—that anyone who wanted coin could get it. As long as most people preferred the convenience of paper, the Bank could issue far more notes than it held in gold reserves.³²

Within three years, the funding model had evolved. By 1697, the Bank's balance sheet showed that **banknotes and bills outstanding made up the lion's share of its funding sources**—not shareholder capital. The Bank was issuing **non-interest-bearing notes** (essentially free money) to fund **interest-bearing government debt**, capturing the spread as profit.³³

The Bank's charter was not a gift; it was a **bargain** (a negotiated exchange of benefits). In exchange for lending to the government on favorable terms, the Bank received privileges that made it the most powerful financial institution in England. Each charter renewal involved an explicit trade:

- **1697**: The Bank increased its capital by £1 million and received a monopoly clause prohibiting other banks by Act of Parliament
- **1708**: The Bank made a £400,000 interest-free loan and gained a prohibition on partnerships of more than six persons from issuing notes
- **1742**: A £1.6 million interest-free loan reduced the interest rate to 3 percent
- **1800**: A £3 million interest-free loan for six years further extended privileges³⁴

Critically, the loans were **never closed out**. When the Bank was nationalised in 1946, the outstanding balance was still £11,015,100—the same amount that had existed in 1834. The debt rolled over indefinitely. This was not a bug but a feature: the permanence of the debt was what made the Bank's notes valuable.³⁵

### Why foreigners accepted it

Domestic circulation was one thing, but England also needed to borrow abroad and trade internationally. Why would foreigners trust paper money?

The genius of the system was that it worked **both domestically and internationally**. At home, the Bank's notes circulated because they were redeemable in coin and accepted for taxes. But why would **foreign creditors** accept this arrangement? Why would a Dutch merchant or a German banker lend to England when the debt was denominated in paper promises?

The answer lay in **parliamentary taxation**. Foreign lenders did not care about the Bank's notes per se; they cared about England's ability to **convert** those notes into gold or goods when needed. And that ability depended on the government's power to tax—what we call **fiscal capacity**: the government's ability to collect taxes and manage public finances. Because Parliament legally controlled taxation, and because Parliament represented the wealthiest subjects, creditors could trust that England would always have the revenue to meet its obligations.³⁶

In other words:
- **Domestically**, taxation made the Bank's notes valuable by creating demand for them
- **Internationally**, taxation made England's promises credible by demonstrating fiscal capacity

This dual function—internal legitimacy and external solvency—was what made Britain's experiment succeed where France's absolutism failed. French kings borrowed more but defaulted often, because they lacked a representative body to secure revenues. England, after 1688, created the opposite model: **limited monarchy, unlimited credit**.³⁷

### The Two-Tier System: Base Money and Private Money

The relationship between Bank of England money and private bank money reveals a pattern that still structures banking today.

While the Bank of England issued its notes, something remarkable happened across England: hundreds of small partnerships—wool merchants in Somerset, ironmasters in Birmingham, cloth traders in Manchester—began issuing their own banknotes.

By 1810, over 700 private banks circulated approximately £22 million in notes. But here's the critical distinction: **these private bank notes derived their value from being convertible into Bank of England notes, which alone could pay taxes**.

Picture a three-tier pyramid:

**Tier 1 (Base Money):** Bank of England notes—accepted by the Exchequer for tax payments  
**Tier 2 (Private Bank Money):** Country bank notes—convertible to Bank of England notes on demand  
**Tier 3 (Reserves):** Gold coin—Bank of England notes convertible to gold

The Exchequer would not accept country bank notes for taxes. This wasn't a technicality—it was the foundational distinction between state-backed money and private substitutes. When tax day arrived, country bank notes had to be converted to Bank of England money. This conversion requirement meant country banks held Bank of England notes as reserves, and those reserves ultimately rested on the Bank's gold holdings and the government's fiscal capacity.³⁸

Thomas Fletcher, our Bristol wool merchant, might hold both types of notes. He'd accept country bank notes from local customers because he could convert them to Bank of England notes. But when the tax collector came, he needed Bank of England notes specifically.

The two-tier system proved the taxation principle: country bank notes circulated precisely because they were convertible into Bank of England notes, which could discharge tax obligations. When country banks suspended convertibility during crises, their notes collapsed in value.³⁹

What England had created, accidentally, was the prototype of modern banking: central bank money (Bank of England notes) supporting commercial bank credit creation (country bank notes). The pattern established in the 1700s still structures monetary systems today: central banks provide base money, commercial banks create private money, and the entire system depends on the state's taxation authority making the base money valuable.

### The French counterfactual

England's success becomes clearer when we see France's failure. Despite being larger and wealthier, France couldn't replicate the Bank of England model.

France's failure to replicate England's success reveals why institutions mattered more than resources. France was larger, wealthier, and more populous than England—yet it paid consistently higher interest rates and suffered repeated debt crises. During 1700-1750, England's government bonds yielded 3-5 percent while France paid 7-11 percent.⁴⁰

The root cause was **serial default**. France restructured or repudiated debts in 1634, 1648, 1652, and 1716. England's only comparable default—the 1672 Stop of the Exchequer—was followed by the 1688 constitutional revolution that made future defaults impossible. Post-1690, Britain never repudiated its perpetual debt.⁴¹

Why couldn't France create its own Bank of England? The institutional prerequisites were absent. England's system depended on Parliament's credible commitment. France had no equivalent. John Law's Banque Générale (1716) attempted to replicate the model, but without parliamentary backing it collapsed spectacularly in 1720. Only Napoleon's reforms in 1800, when he chartered the Banque de France with state backing, finally gave France what England had enjoyed since 1690.⁴²

The comparison reveals a fundamental truth: **financial revolutions require political revolutions**. England's advantage was constitutional, not economic.

### The legacy of 1694

By 1700, England had built something unprecedented: a machine for converting institutional credibility into purchasing power.

The Bank of England's founding marked a turning point in monetary history. For the first time, a government had created an institution that could **manufacture credit on demand**, limited only by the need to maintain confidence. The Bank did not discover some hidden reserve of wealth; it **invented** wealth by making promises believable.

This was not alchemy in the mystical sense but in the practical one: the transformation of base materials (paper, ink, and ledgers) into something that functioned as gold. The trick was not in the paper but in the **institutions** that gave it meaning—Parliament's taxing power, the Bank's monopoly charter, and the legal framework that bound them.

Other nations would try to copy the model. Some, like the Netherlands, succeeded. Others, like France, failed because they lacked the constitutional foundations. The difference was always the same: **trust required institutions, and institutions required limits on arbitrary power**. A king who could dissolve Parliament or repudiate debts could never borrow as cheaply as a government that had surrendered those prerogatives.

The Bank of England proved that the future belonged not to the richest states but to the most **credible** ones. And credibility, it turned out, was not a matter of gold reserves but of legal architecture. The real revolution of 1688 was not political but financial: the discovery that **money is a relationship**, and relationships endure only when they are governed by rules no single party can break.

The institutional revolution was complete. England had created a system where money could be manufactured through lending, backed not by gold but by parliamentary taxation and legal obligation. The two-tier structure—Bank of England notes as base money, country bank notes as credit expansion—would become the template for modern monetary systems worldwide. But this very success would create a new problem: as the system worked so well, people would forget how it actually functioned, replacing institutional understanding with gold fetishism. That forgetting, and its consequences, would shape the next two centuries of monetary history.

### **Chapter Summary**

The Glorious Revolution of 1688 created the institutional foundation for modern central banking by transferring fiscal power from crown to Parliament. Parliamentary control of taxation made England's debt credible for the first time. The Bank of England (1694) completed this revolution by creating a mechanism to manufacture credit on demand: lending £1.2 million to government by issuing banknotes backed by parliamentary guarantees. The Bank's notes circulated domestically because taxes created demand; foreign creditors accepted them because parliamentary taxation demonstrated fiscal capacity. Money creation worked through double-entry bookkeeping: loans created deposits, which when spent and re-deposited, allowed further lending. The perpetual debt structure meant the Bank never needed enough gold to redeem all notes—only enough to maintain confidence in convertibility. A two-tier system emerged with country banks issuing notes convertible to Bank of England money, which alone could pay taxes. France's failure to replicate this success—paying 7-11% interest versus England's 3-5%—proved institutions mattered more than resources. The real revolution was discovering that money is a relationship governed by law, not a commodity backed by metal.
