# PART II: THE INSTITUTIONAL REVOLUTION

## Chapter 4: When Private Money Failed

**Chapter Premise:** Goldsmith banking emerged accidentally after Charles I's 1640 seizure of deposits, creating England's first private paper money through fractional reserve lending. The Stop of the Exchequer in 1672 destroyed this system, proving that private money creation—however ingenious—could not provide systemic stability.

A cold rain fell on London as William of Orange rode through the city gates in December 1688. He had crossed the Channel with an army, but he would take the throne without a battle. King James II, abandoned by his own officers and nobles, had fled to France. What followed was not merely a change of monarchs but a **constitutional revolution**—a permanent transfer of power from crown to Parliament that would reshape not just England's government but its entire financial system.¹

The settlement was explicit: William and Mary would rule, but only if they accepted Parliament's supremacy. The Bill of Rights (1689) declared that the monarch could not suspend laws, levy taxes, or maintain a standing army without parliamentary consent. For the first time in English history, the power to spend and the power to tax were **legally inseparable**. A king could no longer borrow on his personal credit and leave Parliament to clean up the mess. Every loan, every expenditure, every military campaign would require legislative approval.²

This was not a theoretical nicety. It was a **financial revolution** disguised as a political one. By tying the crown's hands, Parliament made England's debt credible. Lenders no longer had to trust a king's word; they could trust a nation's law.

### The goldsmith catastrophe: Why private money failed

To understand what the Bank of England would become, one must first grasp what existed before it—and why it failed catastrophically. The story begins not with the Glorious Revolution but with a desperate wartime improvisation that would accidentally create England's first private paper money, only to see it collapse in spectacular ruin.

In 1640, **Charles I seized £200,000 from the Royal Mint** to finance his escalating conflicts with Parliament and Scotland. The King's agents simply walked into the Mint, took the money, and left merchants and nobles with worthless receipts. The act destroyed confidence in government storage overnight. Wealthy Londoners who had trusted the crown with their bullion now faced a choice: where could they safely store their wealth?³

The answer came from an unlikely source: the goldsmiths of Lombard Street. These were artisans who worked precious metals—craftsmen like Lawrence Hoare and Edward Backwell—whose workshops had strong vaults for securing their inventory. After 1640, they began accepting deposits of gold and silver, issuing receipts as proof of storage. Initially these were simple warehouse receipts: "Received from John Smith ten pounds sterling in gold coin, to be returned upon presentation of this receipt."⁴

But during the English Civil War (1642-1651), a revolutionary change occurred. Goldsmiths began issuing receipts **"payable to bearer"** rather than to a named individual. This subtle shift transformed the receipts from personal IOUs into something that could circulate throughout London. A merchant receiving a goldsmith receipt in payment didn't need to visit the goldsmith to redeem it—he could simply pass it to the next person. London had accidentally invented **the first true private paper money in English history**.⁵

By the 1660s, goldsmith banking had become the dominant force in London finance. Edward Backwell, originally a goldsmith on Fleet Street, had transformed his business into something resembling a modern bank. His depositors included Charles II himself, the future James II, Samuel Pepys, and the East India Company. Other major goldsmith-bankers—Robert Vyner, Alderman John Coggs, Gilbert Whitehall—competed for the business of England's elite.⁶

More revolutionary still, the goldsmith-bankers discovered **fractional reserve banking** (the practice of holding only a fraction of deposits as reserves while lending out the rest). They realized that not all depositors would demand their gold simultaneously. If £1,000 sat in the vault and only £100 was typically withdrawn in a given week, why not lend £500 to a merchant at interest? The goldsmith would create a new receipt—"payable to bearer on demand"—and give it to the borrower, who would spend it into circulation. The goldsmith had just created money through double-entry bookkeeping: the loan was an asset, the receipt a liability.⁷

**Reserve ratios** (the percentage of deposits held as reserves rather than lent out) varied wildly. French banker Richard Cantillon, writing in the 1730s, documented ranges from 10 percent to 66 percent across different goldsmith-bankers. There were no regulations, no statutory requirements, no government oversight. The system operated entirely on reputation and market discipline.⁸

**Was this authorized?** No. Goldsmith banking emerged in a legal gray area—no charters, no parliamentary authorization, purely emergent based on commercial practice. This contrasts sharply with chartered institutions like Sweden's Riksbank (1668) or Amsterdam's Wisselbank (1609), which operated under explicit government mandate. English goldsmith receipts represent perhaps the only clear historical case of large-scale private money creation without initial state sanction.⁹

On the morning of **January 2, 1672**, that foundation crumbled. Charles II, desperate for funds to wage the Third Anglo-Dutch War, issued an order suspending repayment of **£1.3 million** owed to the goldsmith-bankers. The **Stop of the Exchequer**, as it became known, was in effect a sovereign default.

Five major goldsmith banks—including Edward Backwell's firm—went bankrupt within weeks. Nine others were severely undermined. Over **10,000 wealthy families** who had deposited money with the goldsmiths or held their receipts were financially ruined. Bishop Gilbert Burnet recorded that "the bankers were broken, and multitudes who had put their money in their hands were ruined by this dishonourable and perfidious action." Commerce in London "ground to a halt" as credit dried up and cash became scarce.¹⁰

Edward Backwell, one of London's leading goldsmith-bankers, learned of the Stop in January 1672. By then the crown owed him approximately £295,994—nearly his entire capital. Backwell's depositors demanded their money. He could not pay them. The "one-year" moratorium was repeatedly extended, dragging on for years. Backwell continued in official service but his bank never recovered liquidity. In 1682 he was declared bankrupt. He died in exile in 1683.¹¹

Legal battles dragged on until 1700—**twenty-eight years**—with only about half of creditors eventually receiving some payment. The eventual recovery rate was approximately 50 percent—but paid out over decades, meaning the real value was far less.¹²

The Stop proved two things. First, goldsmith receipts had become **true money**—otherwise the default wouldn't have caused such catastrophic systemic disruption. Second, and more importantly, the Stop demonstrated the **fatal flaw of unregulated private money**: no crisis resolution mechanism. When the system failed, there was no lender of last resort, no deposit insurance, no government backstop.¹³

The solution, when it finally came in 1694, was **state intervention**. The Bank of England was chartered explicitly to solve the problems the goldsmith catastrophe had revealed: create a stable institutional framework, provide government finance on sound terms, issue uniform currency backed by parliamentary taxation, and offer crisis liquidity when private credit froze.¹⁴

The Stop of the Exchequer proved that private money creation, however ingenious, could not provide systemic stability. What England needed was not more private ingenuity but a public institution—one that could create money with the full backing of the state's fiscal power. That innovation would come in 1694, but not before one final attempt to solve the crisis through war and revolution. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 would provide the constitutional foundation; the Bank of England would provide the institutional mechanism. Together, they would transform not just England's finances but the nature of money itself.

### Why This Matters Now

The 2008 financial crisis was the goldsmith catastrophe replayed with modern instruments. Shadow banking—money market funds, repo markets, asset-backed commercial paper—had created a vast system of private money creation operating outside traditional banking regulation. Like goldsmith receipts, these instruments circulated as money substitutes backed by private promises. And like 1672, when confidence collapsed, the entire system froze overnight.

The Federal Reserve's response vindicated the lesson England learned in 1694: private money creation requires a public backstop. The Fed became lender of last resort not just to banks but to the entire shadow banking system, creating trillions in emergency liquidity. Without this intervention—without a modern equivalent of the Bank of England—the crisis would have destroyed the financial system as completely as the Stop destroyed goldsmith banking.

Cryptocurrency advocates who dream of purely private money systems should study the goldsmith catastrophe carefully. The goldsmiths were brilliant innovators who created fractional reserve banking and bearer instruments without government authorization. Their system worked beautifully—until it didn't. When crisis came, there was no mechanism to prevent systemic collapse. Private money can exist, but it cannot provide systemic stability. That requires institutions backed by sovereign fiscal power. The lesson of 1672 remains as relevant in the age of Bitcoin as it was in the age of goldsmith receipts: innovation is not enough. Stability requires institutions that can act when private credit fails.

### **Chapter Summary**

Private money creation emerged accidentally in England after Charles I's 1640 seizure of Royal Mint deposits. Goldsmith-bankers began issuing "payable to bearer" receipts that circulated as currency, discovering fractional reserve banking without government authorization. By the 1660s, goldsmith banking dominated London finance, with major bankers like Edward Backwell serving the elite. The Stop of the Exchequer in 1672—Charles II's suspension of £1.3 million in debt payments—destroyed this system catastrophically. Five major banks failed immediately, 10,000 families were ruined, and commerce ground to a halt. The crisis proved that private money creation lacked crisis resolution mechanisms: no lender of last resort, no deposit insurance, no government backstop. The solution would require state intervention—a public institution that could create money with the full backing of parliamentary taxation.
