# PART II: THE INSTITUTIONAL REVOLUTION

## From Private Chaos to Public Credit

The late seventeenth century witnessed a transformation in monetary architecture. Private money creation—the goldsmith-bankers who issued receipts and lent at interest—had proven catastrophically unstable. When Charles II suspended debt payments in 1672, the entire system collapsed. What England needed was not more private ingenuity but a public institution that could create money with the full backing of the state's fiscal power.

The solution emerged from the intersection of constitutional revolution and financial innovation. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 transferred fiscal power from crown to Parliament, making England's debt credible for the first time. The Bank of England's founding in 1694 completed this revolution by creating a mechanism to manufacture credit on demand: lending to government by issuing banknotes backed by parliamentary guarantees.

This Part examines the two-stage process that created modern central banking:

**Chapter 4** tells the story of private money's failure. Goldsmith banking emerged accidentally after Charles I seized deposits from the Royal Mint in 1640. For three decades, these private bankers created money through fractional reserve lending, issuing receipts "payable to bearer" that circulated as currency. The Stop of the Exchequer in 1672 destroyed this system, proving that private money creation—however ingenious—could not provide systemic stability.

**Chapter 5** reveals how the Bank of England solved the credibility problem. By tying the Bank's charter to parliamentary control of taxation, England created an institution that could issue paper money domestically while maintaining gold convertibility for foreign creditors. The mechanics were revolutionary: the Bank created money by lending, with the same funds existing simultaneously as government debt and circulating currency. A two-tier system emerged with country banks pyramiding notes on Bank of England reserves, which alone could pay taxes.

The institutional revolution was complete. England had discovered that money creation required not gold reserves but institutional credibility—the demonstrated capacity to tax, the legal framework binding promises, and the political settlement that made those promises believable. Other nations would try to copy the model. Some would succeed; others would fail. The difference was always the same: trust required institutions, and institutions required limits on arbitrary power.
