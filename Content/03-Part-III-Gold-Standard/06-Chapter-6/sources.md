# Chapter 06 Sources & Summary

### **Chapter Summary**

The gold standard emerged accidentally from Isaac Newton's 1717 revaluation of the guinea. By setting gold's price slightly too high relative to silver, Newton inadvertently made gold more profitable to mint, driving silver out of circulation through Gresham's Law. Britain drifted onto a de facto gold standard by the 1770s, formalized in 1816. The system globalized after 1870 as major economies adopted gold convertibility, creating an international monetary order where currencies maintained fixed exchange rates through gold points (typically 0.4-1.4% of par). The gold standard worked through three mechanisms: legal obligation to convert currency to gold, adequate reserves to meet redemptions, and parliamentary taxation providing fiscal backing. Sterling became the world's reserve currency, with London as financial capital. But the system redistributed wealth from debtor to creditor, periphery to core, imposing deflationary bias that benefited creditors while harming debtors. The gold standard was never neutral—it was a political choice that served creditor interests, sustained by institutional credibility rather than metal's intrinsic value.

The gold standard's apparent success would create a dangerous amnesia. Within two generations, people would forget that paper money had once functioned without metal backing—not as theory but as practiced reality.

Between 1797 and 1821, Britain had fought the world's greatest military power using currency backed by nothing but institutional credibility. The experiment succeeded brilliantly. Yet that success, and the devastating price paid to end it, would be erased from economic memory within a generation. Understanding how this forgetting happened—and who benefited from it—reveals how monetary orthodoxy serves power rather than truth.

3. The "fiat always fails" narrative overlooks that hyperinflation results from productive capacity destruction and foreign currency traps, not money creation per se. Venezuela's oil production collapsed 77% before hyperinflation peaked. Weimar's mark stabilized at 320:1 through mid-1922 despite continued printing, collapsing only after France occupied the Ruhr (eliminating 80% of coal/steel production). Zimbabwe's agricultural output fell 50% seven years before 2007-2008 hyperinflation. Counter-examples prove the opposite: Japan sustains 250% debt-to-GDP with deflation, the US created $8 trillion (2008-2022) with minimal inflation, and Britain's 1797-1821 Bank Restriction (24 years, 226% debt-to-GDP) produced only 22.3% total inflation. The constraint is real resources and institutional capacity, not nominal money supply. Japan can sustain unprecedented debt because it's yen-denominated; Argentina defaults at 75% because it borrows dollars it cannot print. See Epilogue and Appendix A for detailed analysis.

22k. **Methodological note:** While Gustav Godeffroy's commercial activities, Senate positions, and September 1872 resignation are documented through multiple biographical sources including *Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie* and Hamburg city records, the specific details of his currency conversion experience and decision-making rationale are inferred from his documented positions, timing of resignation, firm restructuring, and the economic circumstances Hamburg merchants faced during the transition. The conversion ratios, dates, and Hamburg's political resistance are fully documented. Definitive documentation of Godeffroy's specific motivations and losses would require archival research in Hamburg's Staatsarchiv, particularly the Handelskammer Hamburg proceedings from 1871-1873 and any surviving Godeffroy firm correspondence.
