# PART III: THE GOLD STANDARD ERA AND ITS CONTRADICTIONS

## Chapter 6: Newton's Accident

**Chapter Premise:** Newton's 1717 adjustment accidentally created the gold standard, which globalized by 1880. The system appeared self-regulating but required active Bank of England management and imposed deflationary bias serving creditor interests.

### The Gold Standard Nostalgia

"We need to return to the gold standard." The phrase echoes through political debates, cryptocurrency manifestos, and economic commentary. Gold, advocates argue, would discipline governments, prevent inflation, and restore monetary sanity. Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million coins explicitly mimics gold's scarcity. Ron Paul's "End the Fed" campaign called for gold-backed currency. The nostalgia is powerful: a time when money meant something real, when governments couldn't just print at will.³

But what if the gold standard was never the natural monetary system its advocates imagine? What if it emerged not from economic logic but from a scientist's miscalculation? And what if its century of apparent success concealed a deflationary bias that redistributed wealth from debtors to creditors, from workers to bondholders, from periphery to core?

The gold standard's origins reveal an uncomfortable truth: the system that dominated global finance for a century was an accident. Isaac Newton, trying to fix England's bimetallic currency in 1717, made a small adjustment that would accidentally create the world's monetary order. Understanding how this happened—and why the system worked despite being unintended—illuminates modern debates about monetary constraints, inflation, and the role of central banks.

**This chapter traces how Newton's 1717 calculation accidentally triggered England's shift to gold, how the gold points mechanism supposedly worked automatically, and why this was largely myth.** We'll examine major crises (1825, 1890, 1914) that required active Bank of England management through interest rate manipulation, revealing that the gold standard was never self-regulating. The chapter demonstrates that the system's apparent success stemmed from British institutional credibility—Parliament's taxing power, the Bank's management skill—not from gold itself. This distinction matters because it reveals that monetary constraints are institutional choices, not natural laws embedded in precious metal.

### The Master of the Mint's Miscalculation

On a spring morning in 1717, Isaac Newton—74 years old, Master of the Royal Mint for twenty-one years—stood in his private laboratory at the Tower of London. The room smelled of quicksilver and coal smoke. On the workbench before him lay samples of coins from across Europe: Spanish pieces of eight, French louis d'or, Dutch guilders, Portuguese moidores. Beside them: crucibles, scales precise to a fraction of a grain, and sheets of calculations covered in his meticulous hand.

Newton was conducting an assay—heating each coin to determine its exact precious metal content. He had done this hundreds of times since 1696, when he transformed the Royal Mint from a sinecure into an industrial operation. The Mint's machinery hummed in the floors below: rolling mills flattening metal into sheets, cutting presses stamping blanks, workers weighing and inspecting coins. Newton had overseen the greatest recoinage in English history, melting down **£6.8 million** in clipped and worn silver and reissuing it at full weight.

Yet silver kept disappearing from circulation, flowing abroad despite his best efforts. The problem, Newton had concluded, was not criminal but **mathematical**.¹

**The task:** Determine the proper ratio between gold and silver that would stabilize England's bimetallic currency. Since the recoinage, both metals circulated as money. The guinea (gold coin) was valued at 21 shillings and sixpence (silver equivalent). But the market ratio—what merchants actually paid when trading gold for silver—had shifted due to changing global supplies.

Newton's method was characteristically precise. For each foreign coin, he recorded:
- Weight in grains
- Fineness (purity) determined by fire assay
- Fine metal content (weight × fineness)
- Local currency denomination
- Implied gold-silver ratio

His findings, compiled from weeks of testing:

- **Spain and Portugal**: Gold traded at 16 to 1 against silver
- **France**: 15 to 1  
- **Holland**: 15 to 1
- **European average**: 14.8 to 15 to 1²

England's effective ratio of approximately 15.2 to 1 was an outlier—gold was slightly undervalued relative to silver compared to continental markets. This created arbitrage: merchants could profit by buying silver in England, shipping it abroad, exchanging it for gold at better European ratios, and importing the gold back to England.

**Newton's recommendation:** Reduce the guinea's value from 21 shillings sixpence to 21 shillings even. This would shift England's ratio to approximately 15.5 to 1—closer to (but still slightly above) European norms, reducing the arbitrage incentive.

On September 21, 1717, Newton submitted his report to the Treasury. The language was technical, the recommendation modest: a **2.38% adjustment** in the guinea's official value. Newton expected this would preserve bimetallism by aligning English ratios with European markets. Gold and silver would both continue circulating. The silver drain would stop.

The Treasury accepted his advice. The Royal Proclamation of December 22, 1717, fixed the guinea at **21 shillings**—a ratio of approximately **15.5 to 1** between gold and silver.²

**What Newton expected:** The adjustment would stabilize bimetallism. Both metals would circulate. The problem would be solved.

**What Newton got:** Within decades, silver vanished entirely. The 2.38% adjustment had accidentally made gold slightly *undervalued* at the Mint compared to European markets. Now the arbitrage ran the opposite direction: import gold (worth slightly more in England), export silver (worth slightly more abroad). Merchants responded predictably. Silver drained away. Gold accumulated. By 1774, England was on a de facto gold standard.

**The irony:** History's greatest scientific mind—the man who explained planetary motion, invented calculus, and revolutionized physics—couldn't predict that a 2.38% adjustment would restructure global monetary systems for two centuries. His calculation was mathematically correct. His prediction of consequences was catastrophically wrong.

Newton died March 20, 1727—ten years after his report—believing he had stabilized bimetallism. He hadn't. His modest recommendation had accidentally created the gold standard that would dominate the next 200 years, shape the world economy, and ultimately collapse in depression and war.

It was, as one historian later wrote, "the most consequential accident in financial history."³

What Newton's accident would ultimately prove was not that gold was the foundation of monetary value, but that institutional credibility—the Bank of England's track record, Parliament's taxing power, Britain's fiscal capacity—mattered more than the metal itself. The gold standard worked not because of gold but because of the institutions managing it. When those institutions faltered, as they would in the 1920s and 1930s, gold could not save the system. But in the century after Newton's decision, Britain's institutional strength would make gold seem indispensable, creating a monetary orthodoxy that would dominate the world until 1971.

### The Great Recoinage

To understand Newton's 1717 decision, one must first grasp the crisis that preceded it. By 1695, England's silver coinage had become nearly worthless. Decades of **clipping**—the practice of shaving or cutting metal from coin edges to steal the precious metal while passing the coin at full value—had reduced the average shilling to half its legal weight. Counterfeiters added to the chaos, flooding markets with debased imitations. The Exchequer reported receiving "no more than ten good shillings for every hundred pounds of revenue." Trade ground to a halt; merchants refused payment in coin; the economy teetered on the edge of collapse.⁴

Parliament responded with the Great Recoinage Act of January 1696, ordering all silver coins melted and reissued at full weight. The task fell to the Royal Mint, an institution woefully unprepared for the challenge. Production capacity was minimal; the deadline—June 24, 1696—impossibly tight. By the time old coins were demonetized, only **15 percent** of the needed replacement had been minted. The economy, in the words of one contemporary, "essentially stopped."⁵

Enter Newton. Appointed Warden of the Mint in March 1696 through the patronage of Charles Montague (Chancellor of the Exchequer and fellow of the Royal Society), Newton was expected to treat the position as a reward for his scientific achievements—a comfortable sinecure requiring little actual work. Instead, he attacked the problem with the same intensity he had brought to optics and gravitation.⁶

Newton established **five provincial mints** (York, Bristol, Exeter, Chester, Norwich) to supplement the Tower of London operation. He created sophisticated monitoring systems, tracking daily production at each facility and identifying bottlenecks. He personally supervised the installation of new machinery—horse-powered rolling mills and screw presses that could produce coins far faster than the old hammer method. And he pursued counterfeiters with relentless zeal, personally interrogating suspects and gathering evidence that sent dozens to the gallows, including the notorious William Chaloner, executed on March 23, 1699.⁷

The operation succeeded beyond expectation. Between 1696 and 1699, Newton's mints coined **£6.8 million**—more than the preceding **35 years combined**. The silver currency was restored to full weight and purity. England's monetary crisis was solved.⁸

Or so it seemed.

### The silver drain

Within months of the recoinage's completion, silver began disappearing again. Not through clipping this time, but through **export**. Merchants found they could buy silver coin in England, ship it to the Continent, exchange it for gold, bring the gold back to England, and profit from the difference. The arbitrage was small but persistent. Silver flowed out; gold flowed in. By 1710, the pattern was undeniable. By 1717, it was a crisis.⁹

Newton understood the cause immediately. England's official gold-silver ratio did not match Europe's. On the Continent, gold traded at roughly **15 to 1** against silver—meaning 15 ounces of silver bought one ounce of gold. In England, the ratio was closer to **15.5 to 1**, making silver slightly more valuable relative to gold than abroad. The result was predictable: anyone holding silver in England could profit by converting it to gold, exporting the silver, buying gold abroad at the cheaper continental rate, and importing the gold back to England.¹⁰

This was **Gresham's Law** in action: when two forms of money circulate at a fixed ratio that differs from their market value, the undervalued money (silver, in England) disappears from circulation while the overvalued money (gold) accumulates. The law is often summarized as "bad money drives out good," but the mechanism is more subtle: **arbitrage**—the practice of profiting from price differences between markets by buying low in one place and selling high in another—drives out the money that can be profitably exported.¹¹

Newton's 1717 report laid out the problem with characteristic precision. He had personally **assayed** foreign coins—chemically tested them to determine their purity and exact metal content—including Spanish pieces of eight, French louis d'or, and Dutch guilders, calculating exchange ratios from the results. His findings:

- **Spain and Portugal**: 16 to 1
- **France**: 15 to 1  
- **Holland**: 15 to 1
- **European average**: 14.8 to 15 to 1¹²

England's ratio of 15.5 to 1 was an outlier. Newton's recommendation: reduce the guinea's value to align with continental norms and stop the silver drain. The Treasury accepted his advice, but the adjustment was **too small**. The new ratio of 15.5 to 1 was closer to Europe's average but still slightly overvalued gold. The arbitrage continued, just more slowly.¹³

### Follow the Silver: One Coin's Journey

To understand how Newton's calculation drained England's silver, follow a single crown coin minted in 1720:

**London, April 1720**

A merchant holds a silver crown—5 shillings face value, containing approximately 0.925 ounces of sterling silver (92.5% pure). Under Newton's 1717 adjustment, the official ratio values this silver at:
- **In England:** 5 shillings = 1/4.2 of a guinea (gold coin)
- **Implied silver value:** Based on 15.5:1 gold-silver ratio

But in Amsterdam, the ratio is closer to 15:1. This creates an arbitrage opportunity.

**The merchant's arithmetic:**

1. Take 1,000 silver crowns (£250 face value, ~925 ounces silver)
2. Ship to Amsterdam (cost: £2 for freight and insurance)
3. Sell silver at Amsterdam rates (15:1 ratio)
4. Receive approximately 61.7 ounces of gold
5. Ship gold back to London (cost: £1—gold is more valuable per weight, cheaper to transport)
6. At London Mint, exchange 61.7 ounces gold for guineas
7. At 15.5:1 English ratio, receive more than original £250

**Net profit:** Approximately 3% per round trip—small margins, but volume makes it worthwhile. Merchants with shipping operations already in place could add this to regular trade routes.

**Multiply this by thousands of merchants over decades:**

- **1717:** England has both gold and silver circulating freely
- **1730s:** Silver becoming noticeably scarce in daily transactions
- **1750s:** Silver rarely seen except as small change
- **1774:** Parliament acknowledges reality with massive gold recoinage (155 tonnes)—thirty times the scale of Newton's 1696-99 silver operation, with **no attempt to recoin silver**

The crown coin shipped in 1720 never returned. It was melted in Amsterdam, the silver used for Dutch guilders or shipped to Asia (where silver was valued even higher). In its place came a gold guinea, minted in London, circulating in England. One coin at a time, England's monetary base transformed from bimetallic to gold-only—all because Newton's calculation made the price slightly wrong.

**The timeline of transformation:**

By the 1770s, England was on a de facto gold standard in practice, though not yet in law. The legal recognition came gradually:
- **1797-1821:** Bank Restriction period (paper money without gold convertibility proved institutional credibility mattered more than metal)
- **1816:** Formal adoption of gold standard
- **1821:** Resumption of gold convertibility after Bank Restriction
- **1844:** Bank Charter Act institutionalized gold reserves backing note issue

Newton's 2.38% miscalculation had taken 57 years (1717-1774) to complete the transformation, and another 47 years (1774-1821) to receive formal legal recognition. But the outcome was inevitable once the arbitrage began.¹³

---

### The unintended consequence

Newton died in 1727, a decade after his report, believing he had stabilized England's bimetallic system—a monetary system using both gold and silver as legal currency. He had not. Over the next half-century, silver systematically vanished from English circulation. By the 1770s, silver coins were rare enough that Parliament authorized a massive recoinage—not to restore silver's role but to **acknowledge its disappearance**. In 1774, the Mint recoined **155 tonnes of gold**—thirty times the scale of the 1696-99 silver operation—with no attempt to recoin silver. It was a tacit admission: England was now on a **gold standard** in practice, if not yet in law.¹⁴

The transition was accidental and gradual. No one—not Parliament, not the Treasury, not the Bank of England—set out to create a gold-based monetary system. Most contemporaries wanted to preserve silver as the primary coinage. But economic forces proved stronger than policy intentions. Brazilian gold production had doubled between 1694 and 1724, flooding European markets. England's slightly overvalued gold ratio made it a magnet for this new supply. Gold poured in; silver drained away. By 1800, the transformation was complete.¹⁵

Formal recognition came in stages:

- **1821**: After the Bank Restriction period (1797-1821), Parliament restored convertibility—but only in **gold**. Silver was reduced to "token" coinage for amounts under £2, its value maintained by law rather than metal content.
- **1844**: The Bank Charter Act institutionalized the gold standard, requiring the Bank of England to hold gold reserves backing its note issue beyond a fixed fiduciary limit.¹⁶

As historian Dominic Frisby notes: "Nobody—not the institutions nor the persons involved—had had the slightest intention of creating a new monetary system on gold. Most people wanted to sustain silver as the prime coinage of the land." Yet that is precisely what happened. Newton's modest adjustment, intended to preserve bimetallism, had instead triggered its collapse.¹⁷

### Why Gold Triumphed Over Silver: Three Convergent Forces

Newton's miscalculation created the opportunity for gold to replace silver. But three deeper forces explain why gold, once it began dominating, completely displaced silver as England's monetary base.

**1. Geology and Colonial Discovery**

Gold was inherently scarcer than silver—typically mined at a ratio of 1:10 or less. This scarcity made gold more valuable per unit weight. A merchant carrying £1,000 in gold coins needed perhaps 5 pounds of metal. The same value in silver required 75 pounds. For large transactions—government loans, international trade, land purchases—gold was simply more **convenient**.¹⁸

But the critical geological factor was **Brazilian gold discovery**. Between 1694 and 1724, Brazilian production doubled European gold supply. This new gold had to go somewhere. England's 1717 ratio (15.5:1) made it a profitable destination—merchants could buy gold in Brazil, ship it to England, and exchange it for guineas at favorable rates. The accidental price signal drew gold like a magnet.

Meanwhile, Spanish American silver mines—which had flooded Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries—were showing exhaustion. Production from Potosí (in modern Bolivia) peaked in the 1590s and declined thereafter. As silver became relatively scarcer globally, its value should have risen. But Newton's ratio treated it as if supply were still abundant. The mismatch accelerated the drain.

**2. Politics and Strategic Differentiation**

England's rivals—France, Spain, the Dutch Republic—all used bimetallic or silver-based systems. By drifting to gold (accidentally at first, then deliberately), England differentiated its currency and reduced vulnerability to European monetary manipulations.¹⁹

When France devalued its silver livre in the 1720s, French prices rose relative to gold. English merchants holding gold-backed sterling were insulated—their purchasing power in France actually *increased*. This gave English traders competitive advantages in continental markets.

Moreover, gold's scarcity made it harder for rival states to destabilize England's currency. Silver, being more abundant, was easier for enemies to accumulate and dump on English markets. Gold's limited supply created a natural defense against monetary warfare.

**3. Trust and Institutional Credibility**

The Bank of England's notes were convertible to gold on demand. As the Bank's credibility grew through the 18th century—surviving the South Sea Bubble (1720), managing government debt through multiple wars, maintaining convertibility through the 1772 credit crisis—gold's status as the ultimate reserve strengthened.²⁰

Foreign creditors lending to England wanted assurance that loans could be repaid in universally accepted value. Gold provided that assurance in a way silver—more abundant and more subject to **debasement** (reducing the precious metal content of coins while maintaining their face value)—did not.

The Bank's institutional strength mattered more than gold's intrinsic properties. When the Bank of England suspended gold convertibility in 1797 (Bank Restriction period), paper pounds continued circulating at near-par value for 24 years *without gold backing*. What sustained value wasn't the metal—it was trust in the institution and Parliament's fiscal capacity to tax.

By the time gold convertibility resumed in 1821, the lesson was clear but would be forgotten: **institutional credibility mattered more than metal**. The subsequent success of the gold standard (1821-1914) would erase this insight from public memory, convincing generations that gold itself—not the Bank managing it—was the foundation of monetary stability.

**The Globalization of the Accident**

By the early 19th century, gold had become synonymous with **sound money**. The pound sterling was "as sure as the law of gravity," backed by a fixed weight of gold. Other nations, observing England's financial success, began adopting gold standards of their own. Germany switched in 1871 after unification. The United States effectively adopted gold in 1873 (though formal legal recognition came in 1900). France abandoned bimetallism for gold in 1878. By 1880, most major economies had converged on gold as the monetary anchor.²¹

This created what historians call the **classical gold standard**—a system of fixed exchange rates and supposedly automatic adjustment that would last until World War I shattered it. But the system's foundations were Newton's accident, Brazilian geology, English institutional credibility, and the coincidental exhaustion of Spanish silver mines.

None of it was planned. All of it was presented as natural law.

---

### The gold points mechanism

Exchange rates were fixed by gold content. The pound sterling's $4.8665 parity could fluctuate within narrow bands called **gold points** (±1%). When rates breached these limits, arbitrageurs shipped gold, theoretically creating automatic correction. The system appeared **self-regulating**—or so the theory claimed.²²⁻²⁴

**How gold points actually worked—a concrete example:**

Think of the gold standard like a chain connecting two water tanks (currencies) with a valve (the exchange rate). The water level can vary slightly, but if one tank gets too high or too low, the valve automatically opens to restore balance—or so the theory went.

Here's the mechanism in practice. Suppose the pound-dollar exchange rate was $4.8665 per pound (both currencies defined by specific gold weights). The **gold export point** was typically $4.90—the rate where it became profitable to ship physical gold from New York to London. The **gold import point** was $4.83—where shipping gold from London to New York became profitable.

**Example: Autumn 1890 banking crisis:**

American investors panicked and wanted to convert British securities to dollars. Heavy selling of sterling pushed the exchange rate toward $4.83. At that point, arbitrageurs in London calculated:

1. Buy £1,000 worth of gold from the Bank of England
2. Shipping + insurance cost: approximately 0.7% (about $3.40 per £1,000)
3. Sell gold in New York for dollars
4. Profit margin: if the exchange rate fell below $4.83, the arbitrage covered shipping costs

This gold shipment drained Bank of England reserves, forcing the Bank to raise interest rates (to 6% in November 1890), which made British assets more attractive, reversing the sterling sell-off. Within weeks, the exchange rate stabilized.²²ᵃ

The "automatic" adjustment actually required active Bank management—raising rates, managing reserves, and sometimes borrowing gold from the Bank of France. It was self-regulating only in the sense that a car with power steering is self-driving—the mechanism works, but someone must grip the wheel.²³⁻²⁴

---

### The reality: Active management, not automaticity

Gold movements were far less automatic than theory suggested. David Hume's price-specie flow mechanism predicted that gold outflows would lower prices and restore competitiveness. But evidence shows this rarely happened—prices converged across countries, and capital flows dominated trade flows.²⁵

The Bank of England's secret weapon was **Bank Rate manipulation**. When gold reserves fell, the Bank raised interest rates, attracting foreign capital. Gold flowed in through interest rate differentials, not price adjustments.²⁶ The 1847 crisis illustrated this: when reserves fell to 11.6%, the Bank raised rates to an unprecedented 10%. Within weeks, capital poured back into London.²⁷

This was **discretionary policy**, not automatic adjustment. As Walter Bagehot observed, the Bank actively managed the gold standard, wielding interest rates like a lever to control capital movements.²⁸

### Why foreigners accepted sterling

The gold standard's genius was that it made British promises credible to people who had no stake in British institutions. A German banker lending to an English railway company did not care about Parliament or the Bank of England's charter. He cared about one thing: could he **convert** his sterling claims into gold if needed?²⁹

The answer was yes, and that answer rested on three pillars:

**1. Legal convertibility**: The Bank of England was legally required to exchange notes for gold at a fixed rate (£3 17s 10½d per ounce of standard gold). This was not a promise but an **obligation**, enforceable in court.³⁰

**2. Adequate reserves**: The Bank maintained gold reserves sufficient to meet normal redemption demands. The reserve ratio fluctuated, but the Bank's reputation for prudence meant that most people never tested it.³¹

**3. Parliamentary taxation**: Ultimately, the Bank's gold reserves were backed by the government's ability to tax. If reserves fell dangerously low, the government could raise taxes, accumulate gold, and replenish the Bank's vaults. Foreign creditors understood this: lending to England was lending to a state with proven fiscal capacity.³²

This combination—legal obligation, adequate reserves, and fiscal backing—made sterling the world's reserve currency. By 1900, more international trade was invoiced in pounds than in all other currencies combined. London was the world's financial capital, and the Bank of England was its central bank. The gold standard had globalized trust, creating a system where a German, a Japanese, and an Argentine could all accept payment in sterling because they all trusted England's commitment to gold convertibility.³³

---

### The hidden subsidy

Yet the system had a dark side. The gold standard was not neutral; it **redistributed** wealth from debtor to creditor, from periphery to core, from colony to metropole. Countries on the gold standard had to maintain reserves, which meant accumulating gold rather than spending on development. Gold-producing regions—South Africa, Australia, California—enjoyed advantages; gold-importing regions suffered chronic deflation.³⁴

Britain benefited enormously. As the world's largest creditor and the issuer of the reserve currency, it could borrow cheaply and lend expensively. The **interest rate differential**—the spread between what Britain paid on its debts and what it earned on its loans—was a hidden subsidy, extracting wealth from the rest of the world. India, forced onto the gold standard as part of the British Empire, had to accumulate sterling reserves rather than invest in infrastructure. The cost was borne by Indian taxpayers; the benefit accrued to London bankers.³⁵

The gold standard also imposed **deflationary bias**. Because gold supply grew more slowly than economic output, prices tended to fall over time. This benefited creditors (who were repaid in more valuable money) and harmed debtors (who had to repay loans with scarcer currency). The late 19th century saw persistent deflation in gold standard countries, contributing to agrarian unrest and political instability.³⁶

These costs were invisible to contemporaries, who saw the gold standard as a natural and neutral system. But they were real, and they would accumulate until the system collapsed under its own contradictions in the 1930s.


---

### **Chapter Summary**

The gold standard emerged accidentally from Isaac Newton's 1717 revaluation of the guinea. By setting gold's price slightly too high relative to silver, Newton inadvertently made gold more profitable to mint, driving silver out of circulation through Gresham's Law. Britain drifted onto a de facto gold standard by the 1770s, formalized in 1816. The system globalized after 1870 as major economies adopted gold convertibility, creating an international monetary order where currencies maintained fixed exchange rates through gold points (typically 0.4-1.4% of par). The gold standard worked through three mechanisms: legal obligation to convert currency to gold, adequate reserves to meet redemptions, and parliamentary taxation providing fiscal backing. Sterling became the world's reserve currency, with London as financial capital. But the system redistributed wealth from debtor to creditor, periphery to core, imposing deflationary bias that benefited creditors while harming debtors. The gold standard was never neutral—it was a political choice that served creditor interests, sustained by institutional credibility rather than metal's intrinsic value.

The gold standard's apparent success would create a dangerous amnesia. Within two generations, people would forget that paper money had once functioned without metal backing—not as theory but as practiced reality.

Between 1797 and 1821, Britain had fought the world's greatest military power using currency backed by nothing but institutional credibility. The experiment succeeded brilliantly. Yet that success, and the devastating price paid to end it, would be erased from economic memory within a generation. Understanding how this forgetting happened—and who benefited from it—reveals how monetary orthodoxy serves power rather than truth.

Zimbabwe's agricultural output fell 50% seven years before 2007-2008 hyperinflation. Counter-examples prove the opposite: Japan sustains 250% debt-to-GDP with deflation, the US created $8 trillion (2008-2022) with minimal inflation, and Britain's 1797-1821 Bank Restriction (24 years, 226% debt-to-GDP) produced only 22.3% total inflation. The constraint is real resources and institutional capacity, not nominal money supply. Japan can sustain unprecedented debt because it's yen-denominated; Argentina defaults at 75% because it borrows dollars it cannot print. See Epilogue and Appendix A for detailed analysis.
