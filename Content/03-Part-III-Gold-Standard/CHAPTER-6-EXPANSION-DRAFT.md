### Germany's golden windfall

Germany's switch to gold in 1871 transformed what had been England's accidental monetary system into a global standard. The mechanism reveals how war booty, not economic wisdom, created monetary regimes.

When Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck unified Germany in January 1871 after defeating France, the new German Empire faced monetary chaos. The northern states used Prussian **thalers** (silver coins), the southern states used **gulden**, and Hamburg maintained its own **mark banco** system. Unification required currency standardization, but Germany lacked the gold reserves to back a unified currency.

Then came the Treaty of Frankfurt (May 10, 1871), ending the Franco-Prussian War. France owed Germany **5 billion gold francs** in war reparations—the largest financial transfer in history to that point, equivalent to approximately 25% of French GDP. This windfall gave Bismarck what he needed: enough gold to back the new **Reichsmark** without disrupting Germany's economy.²¹ᵃ

The legislation came swiftly. On December 4, 1871, the law authorizing gold mark coinage passed. The comprehensive German Coinage Act (Münzgesetz) followed on July 9, 1873, establishing gold monometallism at a rate of 1,395 marks per pound of gold. The Berlin mint suspended silver coinage in July 1871—even before formal legislation—signaling the inevitable shift.²¹ᵇ

But Germany's decision created an immediate crisis for its neighbors. The German Empire held massive silver reserves from its old currency systems—approximately 800 million marks' worth of silver coins and bullion. To obtain gold for the new Reichsmark, Germany began selling this silver on European markets. The volume was staggering: the silver flooding Europe amounted to roughly **one-third of France's total specie holdings**.²¹ᶜ

Silver prices collapsed. France's mints, which had coined only 5 million francs of silver in 1871-1872, suddenly faced **154 million francs** worth of silver presented for coinage in 1873 as merchants rushed to convert depreciating silver before it lost more value. On **September 6, 1873**—one day after France completed its final reparations payment to Germany—the French government suspended free silver coinage. The Latin Monetary Union (France, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland) followed suit. The Netherlands suspended silver in 1875. Within two years, Germany's adoption had forced most of continental Europe off silver.²¹ᵈ

The domino effect was not economic optimization. It was defensive panic. Germany's decision to dump silver reserves created what economist Marc Flandreau called "pictures of a revolution" in the global monetary system—a cascading crisis that forced countries to choose between absorbing depreciated silver or joining the gold bloc.²¹ᵉ

**What matters is not that Germany chose wisely but that France's war reparations made the choice possible.** Without that 5 billion franc windfall, Germany would likely have remained on silver, and the gold standard might never have globalized. Monetary regimes are shaped by war outcomes, not theoretical superiority.

### A Hamburg senator's dilemma

**Hamburg, September 1872**

Gustav Godeffroy sat in his office overlooking the Elbe River, watching cargo ships unload at the docks his family's trading house had used for generations. At fifty-five, he was one of Hamburg's most prominent citizens: Senator since 1854, partner in J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn (one of the city's great trading houses with 29 deep-water sailing vessels), and Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Norddeutsche Bank. For eighteen years, he had represented Hamburg's mercantile interests in the Senate, defending the city's independence against Prussian centralization.²²ᵃ

Now he faced a choice that would define Hamburg's future—and his own.

The new German Empire demanded Hamburg abandon its ancient currency systems and adopt the Reichsmark. Hamburg had maintained two parallel currencies since the 17th century: the **mark banco** (bank money used for major transactions) and the **mark courant** (circulating currency for daily commerce). These systems had served the city's merchants for two centuries, insulating Hamburg from the monetary instabilities that plagued other German states.²²ᵇ

But the Empire was insistent. Bismarck's government offered 30 million Hamburg marks as "compensation" for the transition—essentially a bribe to overcome resistance. The Senate, after fierce internal debate, prepared to capitulate in October 1872.²²ᶜ

Godeffroy understood what the others did not: the conversion ratios would destroy wealth. The official terms set the **mark courant at 1.2 German marks**—a 16.7% devaluation overnight. Any Hamburg merchant holding contracts denominated in mark courant, accounts receivable from customers, or bonds payable in the old currency would see those assets shrink by nearly one-sixth when converted.²²ᵈ

His own firm had exposure: contracts for Pacific copra shipments payable in mark courant, outstanding loans to German coal mines, receivables from customers across Europe. The exact losses were difficult to calculate—they depended on which contracts could be renegotiated and which customers would pay old debts in depreciated currency. But the direction was clear: wealth would transfer from holders of mark courant to holders of gold or gold-backed assets.

Meanwhile, the **mark banco** would convert at **1.5 German marks**—a 50% appreciation. The Rothschild-connected banking houses that held mark banco accounts would profit handsomely. The pattern was unmistakable: the currency transition redistributed wealth upward, from commercial traders to financiers, from Hamburg's traditional merchant class to the new imperial banking elite.²²ᵉ

On **September 10, 1872**—precisely one month before the Senate's final capitulation—Godeffroy resigned. The timing spoke volumes. Hamburg newspapers noted it with surprise: a Senate seat was typically held for life, and Godeffroy was only fifty-five, in perfect health, at the peak of his influence. The official explanation cited "personal business matters."²²ᶠ

By December 1872, Godeffroy had founded a new firm under his own name—"Gustav Godeffroy"—separate from the family trading house. He was repositioning for the new monetary order, creating structures that could navigate the transition without bearing the full weight of the old firm's mark courant exposure.²²ᵍ

The strategy wasn't enough. The J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn trading house, still led by his brother Johann Cesar VI, entered bankruptcy proceedings in December 1879. The official explanation cited "lack of liquidity" and "speculations with German mining stocks" in 1878. But the financial pressures had been building since 1873—the year of the currency conversion and the year of the great financial panic that followed Germany's silver dumping. Whether the 1871-1873 currency transition losses contributed to the 1879 bankruptcy is unclear; the documentation attributes failure to 1878 speculation. But the timing is suggestive.²²ʰ

What is certain is that Hamburg's forced integration into the Reichsmark system destroyed the city's monetary independence. Senator Gustav Heinrich Kirchenpauer, Hamburg's long-standing envoy to the Federal Council, had "fought for the special position of Hamburg" on currency matters, but the Empire's financial pressure—that 30 million mark payment—proved insurmountable. By February 15, 1873, the conversion was official. Old Hamburg marks circulated for nearly two more years before being withdrawn on January 1, 1875.²²ⁱ

Hamburg's merchants had opposed joining the German Customs Union, favoring free trade. The Chamber of Commerce, the stock exchange, and the Senate had all been "decisively for free trade." But Bismarck's imperial consolidation overrode local preferences. The monetary transition was the final blow: Hamburg was no longer an independent mercantile republic but a provincial city within the German Empire.²²ʲ

Gustav Godeffroy had seen it coming and gotten out. His September 1872 resignation—one month before the Senate's capitulation, six months before the official conversion, thirty months before the final withdrawal of old currency—was the act of a man who understood that Hamburg's golden age had ended. The new monetary order would be built on Prussian terms, backed by French gold, serving imperial interests. The old merchant families of Hamburg would have to adapt or perish.

**The currency transition revealed what gold standard advocates never acknowledged: monetary regime changes redistribute wealth and power.** Godeffroy's experience—a documented Hamburg merchant-senator resigning during the crucial debate, repositioning his business for the new order, watching his family's trading house ultimately fail—shows how abstract monetary policy translates into concrete commercial consequences. The gold standard was not neutral. It was a political choice that created winners and losers, creditors and debtors, metropoles and peripheries.²²ᵏ
