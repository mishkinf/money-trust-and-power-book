# Chapter 9: Manufacturing Orthodoxy

## The Paradox of Intellectual Defeat and Legislative Victory

In September 1843, James Wilson founded *The Economist* magazine to promote free trade and argue for monetary reform. Week after week, the magazine attacked the Currency School's rigid doctrines. Wilson published sophisticated critiques of the proposed Bank Charter Act, warning that it would fail to control credit creation. When Robert Torrens, a Currency School defender, published his rebuttal in 1848, the title told the story: *The Principles and Practical Operation of Sir Robert Peel's Bill of 1844 Explained, and Defended Against the Objections of Tooke, Fullarton, and Wilson*. Wilson was grouped with Thomas Tooke and John Fullarton—the Banking School's leading theorists—as an opponent requiring systematic refutation.¹

Yet on July 19, 1844, the Bank Charter Act received Royal Assent with overwhelming parliamentary support. Wilson's Economist, Tooke's theoretical treatises, Fullarton's detailed critiques—all had failed. The Currency School had won completely. Not because they controlled the press (they demonstrably didn't), not because they silenced opposition (Banking School voices remained prominent), but because they captured the institution that mattered: **Parliament**.²

This reveals something crucial about how economic orthodoxy gets manufactured. It's not always about controlling all channels of discourse. Sometimes it's about controlling the decisive channel—the one that translates ideas into law. The Banking School had intellectual sophistication, prominent advocates, and access to influential publications. They lost anyway. Understanding how reveals that monetary orthodoxy isn't discovered through neutral inquiry—it's enacted through institutional power.³

The transformation from 1694 understanding (the Bank creates money "out of nothing") to 1850 orthodoxy (taxes must fund spending) didn't happen by accident. It was manufactured through institutional power that embedded Currency School doctrine into the architecture of British economic life. Understanding **how** this erasure happened reveals that monetary orthodoxy is ideological construction, not natural economic law.⁴

## The Parliamentary Triumph: The Bank Charter Act of 1844

### Peel's Doctrine: Defining Money as Gold

Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel opened the debate on May 6, 1844, defining the pound as "a certain definite quantity of gold"—not an abstract unit, not a promise backed by taxation, but physical metal.⁵ This Currency School doctrine made alternatives literally unthinkable. What William Paterson stated in 1694—that the Bank creates money "out of nothing"—was now conceptually impossible. What Adam Smith wrote in 1776 about taxation giving value to paper money was forgotten.⁶

Peel's system removed monetary policy from political contestation. The Bank would split into two departments. Note issuance above £14 million would be "governed in amount by the fluctuations in the stock of bullion"—automatically contracting when gold flowed out.⁷ No parliamentary debate, no democratic choice, no employment considerations. Deflation served creditor interests perfectly: rising bond values, protected returns. All presented as natural economic law.⁸

The Act prohibited new banks from issuing notes, froze existing country banks' issuance at 1844 levels, and eliminated note-issuing rights upon merger. By economic attrition, private note issuance would disappear.⁹ Peel framed this as completing work begun in 1819, establishing continuity with the Resumption Act that had triggered devastating 1821 deflation. His political authority gave Currency School theory the weight of statesmanship.¹⁰

### The Banking School Opposition: Prophetic Warnings

**Benjamin Hawes**, Member of Parliament for Lambeth, led the opposition on June 13, 1844, arguing there was no evidence to justify interfering with banks' note issuance.¹³

Hawes made the Banking School's core argument: if bank notes can be converted to gold on demand, that convertibility already provides sufficient safeguard. "There is an adequate and sufficient check upon the issues of bank notes," he argued—Peel's additional restrictions were unnecessary.¹⁴

He challenged the Currency School's central claim head-on: where was the proof that convertible paper money caused high prices? After searching committee evidence and testimony, Hawes found no examples actually linking convertible bank notes to inflation. The Currency School was legislating based on theory, not evidence.¹⁵

Most remarkably, Hawes predicted exactly what would happen—and was ignored. Restrict the legal currency below what the economy actually needs, he warned, and people will find alternatives: "the necessity for a circulating medium of some kind will prove too strong for your legislation, and will lead to a system of dealing in small bills and acceptances."¹⁶

This prediction proved devastatingly accurate. The Act was suspended during crises in 1847, 1857, and 1866. Credit found alternative forms—through bills of exchange and, most importantly, through deposits the Currency School failed to recognize as money.¹⁷

**Mr. Hastie** warned of catastrophic collapse. **Charles Newdegate** spoke for agricultural interests: price reductions from currency contraction hit workers hardest—"a sheer loss without the shadow of an equivalent."¹⁸

### What Wasn't Debated

Remarkably, no MP cited Adam Smith's 1776 insight about taxation giving value to paper money. No one referenced the Bank Restriction period (1797-1821) as evidence paper money worked without gold—except Hawes, who was promptly ignored.¹⁹

The idea Paterson articulated in 1694—that the Bank creates money "out of nothing"—was now unspeakable. Even the Banking School accepted the Currency School's premise that gold backing was necessary. The chartalist understanding had been so thoroughly erased it didn't appear as an option to reject.²⁰

Though no division lists survive, the debates make clear the bill enjoyed overwhelming support. Opposition speakers acknowledged their minority status.²¹ Chancellor Henry Goulburn noted the measure "had consequently met with the concurrence" of those who heard all objections.²²

The Currency School won—not by silencing opposition, but by controlling the institution that translated theory into law.

## The Intellectual Architecture: Lord Overstone's Shadow

Though absent from parliamentary speeches (he was not an MP), **Samuel Jones Loyd** (1796-1883)—later Baron Overstone—served as the Bank Charter Act's true architect. His testimony before the 1840 Select Committee on Banks of Issue and his published works established Currency School doctrine:

- *Reflections Suggested by a Perusal of Mr. J. Horsley Palmer's Pamphlet* (1837)
- *Further Reflections on the State of the Currency* (1837)
- *Remarks on the Management of the Circulation* (1840)
- *Thoughts on the Separation of the Departments of the Bank of England* (1844)²⁴

An 1857 parliamentary debate explicitly acknowledged his authorship: "The noble Lord opposite (Lord Overstone) **one of its chief promoters, and generally supposed to be its author**, upon the question of the note circulation keeping pace with the increase or decrease of gold, said— 'The issues of the Bank of England will, under the provisions of that Bill, be made to conform strictly to the fluctuations of the bullion.'"²⁵

Loyd's influence operated through ideas and evidence, not position. He didn't need parliamentary office—Peel's political authority enacted Loyd's intellectual framework.

## The Academic Presence

The Currency School's dominance extended to academic economics. Nassau William Senior held Oxford's Drummond Professorship during the Currency School's rise (1825-30) and legislative triumph (1847-52). John Stuart Mill's *Principles of Political Economy* (1848) became the standard textbook, running through seven editions until 1919. While Mill engaged both schools, he accepted the gold standard premise.²³ By 1850, dissenting views had been excluded from respectable economic discourse.

## A Victim Who Understood: Harold Heslop's Story

The manufactured orthodoxy didn't just harm workers in abstract ways—it destroyed specific lives that we can document. Harold Heslop's trajectory reveals how the Bank Charter Act of 1844 had consequences that rippled through generations.

**Harold Heslop** (1898-1983) was born into a multi-generational mining family in Hunwick, County Durham. At age 13, in 1911, he started work at Boulby ironstone mine. Later he worked at Harton Colliery, South Shields, becoming secretary of his local Independent Labour Party branch and a Durham Miners' Association council representative. His political consciousness and organizing skills earned him a scholarship to Central Labour College in London, where he studied from 1923 to 1926—the exact period when Winston Churchill made his fateful decision to return Britain to gold at the pre-war parity.³³

Heslop returned to Harton Colliery in 1926, witnessing the General Strike firsthand. On March 27, 1926, he married Phyllis Hannah Varndell, a clerk at Selfridges, three months before the strike began. **In late 1927, as the coal industry contracted under the pressure of the overvalued pound, mine owners made Heslop unemployed.** He remained unemployed thereafter, eventually moving to London.³⁴

But Heslop did what the orthodoxy's architects had prevented Thomas Attwood from doing: he documented the experience for posterity. His novels transformed lived suffering into literary testimony:

- *Goaf* (1926 in Russian, 1934 in English) about northern England mining
- *The Gate of a Strange Field* (1929) about the 1926 General Strike
- *Last Cage Down* (1935) and *The Earth Beneath* (1946) about Durham's coalfields
- Posthumous autobiography *Out of the Old Earth* (1994) with "rich recollections of childhood in the coalfield... fine descriptions of working life above and below ground"³⁵

**As a Central Labour College graduate, Heslop likely understood the broader economic forces** better than most miners. He had studied political economy, labor history, and organizing strategy. Yet he couldn't escape the consequences of policies embedded in law 83 years before his unemployment. The Bank Charter Act of 1844 had institutionalized monetary contraction that required gold backing. When Churchill returned to gold at an overvalued parity in 1925, he triggered the mechanism that the Currency School had built: automatic deflation, industrial contraction, mass unemployment.³⁶

Heslop's papers remain at Durham University Special Collections (reference GB-0033-HES), a documentary archive of one man's attempt to tell the story that orthodox economics had erased. The manufactured orthodoxy of the 1840s claimed its victims through the 1920s-1930s—and some of them wrote it down.³⁷

## Why Legislative Capture Worked

The Currency School's triumph reveals a crucial pattern: **you don't need to control all discourse to manufacture orthodoxy—you need to control the decisive institution**. The Banking School had prominent voices (Tooke, Fullarton, Wilson), sophisticated arguments, access to *The Economist*, parliamentary representation, and prophetic warnings that proved correct.³⁴ But the Currency School had Peel's authority, Overstone's framework, the 1840 Committee's evidence—and the votes.³⁵

The Banking School lost not because they were silenced but because their influence operated in channels that didn't translate into law. Once Peel's bill passed, it didn't matter that *The Economist* published critiques weekly or that Hawes warned in Parliament.³⁶ **Legislative capture trumps intellectual debate**. The Currency School embedded their principles into automatic law—when gold flowed out, money contracted without democratic input. And when the Act had to be suspended during crises (1847, 1857, 1866), proving the Banking School right, it was reinstated afterward.³⁷

The orthodoxy persisted because it served concentrated interests. Deflation increased bondholders' returns. Gold constraints limited government spending. Financial mystification made banking seem like natural intermediation rather than state-sanctioned credit expansion. Those interests had the political power to maintain orthodoxy through legislative force.³⁸

---

**Why This History Matters Now:**

You've just read about how Parliament embedded creditor-friendly monetary orthodoxy into British law while prominent voices opposed it. The Banking School had sophisticated arguments, influential publications, and parliamentary representation—yet they lost because the Currency School controlled the decisive institution.

This pattern operates today. When the European Central Bank's statutes prohibit monetary financing of government deficits, that's legislative capture embedding creditor interests into automatic law—exactly like the Bank Charter Act's gold rules. When "central bank independence" is enshrined in law, insulating monetary policy from democratic pressure, that's the modern equivalent of Peel's "automatic" gold standard. When think tanks produce "research" showing government debt is unsustainable while ignoring unused productive capacity, that's contemporary *Economist*-style manufacture of orthodoxy.⁴⁴

The key insight: monetary orthodoxy isn't discovered; it's constructed. It serves specific interests (creditors, wealth-holders, financial institutions) while claiming universal benefit. Recognizing this pattern helps us evaluate contemporary fiscal debates skeptically: when someone claims a policy is "economically necessary," ask who benefits from that necessity being accepted as fact.⁴⁵

### Peel's Tragic Error: The Birth of Modern Deposit Banking

The Bank Charter Act of 1844 represents one of history's great unintended consequences. Peel crafted legislation to end fractional reserve banking. He succeeded in destroying private note issuance. He utterly failed to control credit creation.

The Act prohibited new banks from issuing notes, froze existing country banks' issuance at 1844 levels, and mandated banks lose note-issuing rights upon merger. In 1844, 277 country banks issued £8.6 million in notes. By 1921, Fox, Fowler and Company issued the last private English banknote—a 77-year transition to Bank of England monopoly.²⁴

But the Currency School made a "tragic error": they assumed bank deposits weren't money. They focused obsessively on paper notes while ignoring checking accounts. Banks immediately pivoted. As monetary historian Charles Goodhart writes, "Both the Bank of England and the country banks, deprived of the right to issue notes at will, began to issue deposits to a fare-thee-well." **Fractional reserve banking didn't end—it simply changed to demand deposits**.²⁵

**The regulatory failure can be visualized simply**: Peel's Currency School tried to lock water in a container by welding shut one valve while leaving five other valves wide open. They succeeded in closing the note-issuance valve completely—but money creation simply flowed through the deposit-creation valves instead. By 1900, 99.91% of transactions used deposits rather than notes. The Act meticulously controlled something that became irrelevant while accidentally authorizing the very thing it was designed to prevent: unconstrained private money creation.

The intellectual blind spot was profound. Victorian economists could see physical banknotes as money but viewed deposit entries as merely records of money. They were wrong. When a bank wrote "+£5" next to a customer's name, that accounting entry *was* money—identical in function to a £5 note. Money had to be tangible, they believed. This blindness led to history's greatest regulatory failure: meticulously controlling visible banknotes while ignoring functionally identical invisible deposits.²⁶

**[VISUAL-AID-9.1] Figure 9.1: Notes vs. Deposits — Functionally Identical Money**

The Currency School's fatal error was treating these as different:

```
BANK NOTE (Visible)              |  BANK DEPOSIT (Invisible)
─────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────
Physical paper printed by bank   |  Ledger entry in bank's books
                                 |
Promises to pay £5 on demand     |  Promises to pay £5 on demand
                                 |
Bearer can transfer to others    |  Holder can transfer by check
                                 |
Accepted as payment for debts    |  Accepted as payment for debts
                                 |
Created when bank makes loan     |  Created when bank makes loan
                                 |
REGULATED BY 1844 ACT            |  NOT REGULATED (workaround)
─────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────

RESULT BY 1900:
• Bank notes: 0.09% of transactions
• Bank deposits: 99.91% of transactions

The Act meticulously controlled what became irrelevant while 
ignoring what became dominant. Form changed, function identical.
```

Even brilliant economists missed this. **John Stuart Mill** (1848) denied credit could "make something out of nothing"—yet loans literally create deposits. **Walter Bagehot** (1873) believed "banks cannot create money."²⁷ Not until **Keynes's *Treatise on Money* (1930)** was the truth stated explicitly: "banks can safely create" money "provided they move forward in step." But even Keynes retreated in his 1936 *General Theory*. The full articulation awaited Post-Keynesian economists—**Basil Moore's 1988** *Horizontalists and Verticalists* finally explained: "loans create deposits," not the reverse.²⁸

Why did it take so long? **Deposit creation was invisible**. When a country bank printed a £5 note, everyone could see new money. When a bank created a £5 deposit by writing in a ledger, nothing physical changed. Victorian economists couldn't grasp that accounting could create purchasing power as effectively as printing.²⁹

The Currency School regulated the visible while ignoring the invisible. Deposit banking operated unconstrained—no reserve requirements, no capital requirements, no limits. By 1900, deposits dominated: **99.91% of transactions by value**. Peel had banned visible private money while accidentally authorizing invisible private money creation on unprecedented scale.³⁰

The United States followed a parallel trajectory with state bank notes. The National Banking Acts (1863-1864) imposed a **10% tax on state bank notes**, making their issuance uneconomical. State bank note circulation "fell from $143 million in 1865 to $4 million by 1867"—effectively eliminated through punitive taxation rather than direct ban. But state banks discovered the same workaround as English banks: deposits. "By the 1880s, deposit accounts had changed the primary source of revenue for many banks," and "by the 1890s, **90% of the money supply was in checking accounts**." Individual deposits grew from 5% to 23% of GDP between 1863 and 1913, with deposits rising from 96% to 592% of bank capital. State banking made a dramatic comeback through deposit creation, which faced no equivalent tax.²⁷ˡ

What emerged on both sides of the Atlantic was the modern two-tier monetary system: **central bank base money (reserves and currency) at the foundation, with commercial banks creating deposit money on top**. The Bank of England and later the Federal Reserve (1913) provided reserves—the settlement medium banks needed to clear payments with each other. Commercial banks created deposits through lending, multiplying the money supply far beyond the base. The hierarchy that had existed informally when country banks pyramided notes on Bank of England reserves was now formalized: banks needed central bank reserves for settlement, but they created most circulating money through deposit expansion.²⁷ᵐ

The Currency School's failure to understand this mechanism reveals a profound truth about money: **the form matters less than the function**. Whether money circulates as paper notes or electronic deposits, the mechanism is the same—banks create purchasing power by lending, constrained not by reserves but by demand for credit and confidence in the banking system. Peel's Act tried to control money by controlling its physical form. But money is not a thing; it is a relationship, a ledger entry, a promise. Changing the medium from notes to deposits didn't eliminate private money creation—it merely made it invisible, operating through accounting entries rather than printed paper.²⁷ⁿ

The irony is complete: the Act designed to establish state control over money creation instead **perfected private money creation** by driving it underground into deposit banking, where it would operate with even less oversight for the next century. The principle that William Paterson had articulated in 1694—that the Bank "hath benefit of interest on all moneys which it creates out of nothing"—remained true. Only now, hundreds of commercial banks were creating money out of nothing through deposit expansion, and the Currency School's legislative triumph had made this process less visible and less regulated than the note issuance it replaced.²⁷ᵒ

The transformation was complete. Within 50 years of Adam Smith's explicit statement that princes could give value to paper money through taxation, such ideas had become nearly unspeakable. The gold standard's success—its century of apparent stability from 1821 to 1914—would cement this false narrative so deeply that even its collapse in the 20th century would not fully dislodge it. The household budget metaphor, the idea that governments must "find the money" before they can spend, would persist long after the gold that supposedly justified it had disappeared from the monetary system.²⁷ʰ

The Act meticulously controlled something that became irrelevant while accidentally authorizing unconstrained private money creation through deposits.

Peel's failure teaches us that you can't control money creation by regulating one form while ignoring others—a lesson financial regulators keep forgetting (see: shadow banking, 2008).

### A Banker Who Adapted: Samuel Gurney's October Crisis

**Samuel Gurney** sat before the Parliamentary Committee in late 1847, his Quaker dress marking him as a member of Norfolk's most prominent banking family. For nearly four decades, he had guided Gurney's Bank through financial storms, but the October crisis had tested the Bank Charter Act's iron restrictions in ways Robert Peel never anticipated.³¹

When panic swept London, depositors at Overend, Gurney & Company—the "bankers' banker" serving country banks across England—demanded their money. The Act's rigid cap on note issuance meant Gurney couldn't expand circulation to meet the panic, even with £8 million in deposits backing his operations. The crisis peaked on October 25th. Then the government suspended the Act.³²

"Those who had sent notice for their money in the morning," Gurney testified, "sent us word that they did not [need it]."³³

The effect was immediate. The panic that the Act's restrictions had inflamed vanished the moment those restrictions lifted. Gurney understood what Peel's elegant theory had missed: in moments of crisis, confidence mattered more than currency ratios. His bank would survive by embracing deposit banking over note issuance, but the lesson was clear—the Act's inflexibility had transformed a difficult situation into catastrophe.

---

Scotland's "free banking" era (1716-1845) is often cited as proof that private money doesn't need state foundation. But this dissolves upon examination. Scottish banks operated entirely within British state frameworks—parliamentary charters, British common law enforcement, settlement in Bank of England notes, and access to the Bank as informal lender of last resort. The lesson: **private innovation and public foundation are complements, not substitutes**. Scotland's success required British legal institutions, monetary framework, and crisis backstops.²⁷ʸ ²⁸¹ ²⁸⁴

### Colonial proof: Taxation drives money through force

While 19th-century orthodoxy denied that taxation drives currency adoption, colonial administrators demonstrated this principle empirically through systematic coercion. **British colonial hut taxes** were explicitly designed to force currency adoption. By the 1890s-1910s, Kenya, Uganda, Rhodesia, and other colonies implemented hut or poll taxes **payable only in colonial currency**.²⁷ⁱ Kenya's 1901 Hut Tax Ordinance required 2-3 rupees per hut annually. Before 1901, Kenyan communities used cattle wealth and barter. The tax forced families to sell to settlers for rupees or send members to wage labor on colonial plantations.²⁷ʲ

**Rodger Cantwell**, a 30-year-old farm laborer in Toomyvara, County Tipperary, experienced this monetary contraction through Irish landlord distress. One of 30 laborers on George Fawcett's estate, Cantwell earned 5 pence daily in 1846, supporting his wife Mary and five children—Bridget (8), Thomas (7), Michael (4), Julia (2), and Mary (1). When the potato blight destroyed his subsistence crop, he joined public works for 10 pence daily—double his farming wages but inadequate for seven people.²⁷ᵏ

The 1847 harvest was one-fourth normal size. The credit contraction that Samuel Gurney testified about in London reached Tipperary through falling agricultural prices and restricted lending. Fawcett faced his own financial distress. **In June 1849, Fawcett's agent destroyed all 30 tenant cabins overnight**—a mass eviction driven by the landlord's inability to pay Poor Law rates on a contracting estate. Cantwell's family emigrated to America in 1850, children on the ship *Princeton* in April, Rodger on the *Waterton* six months later.²⁷ˡ

Cantwell's suffering connected directly to the Bank Charter Act. The 1847 credit contraction affected Irish estates through multiple channels: English merchants stopped advancing credit for grain purchases, landlords faced falling rents and increased Poor Law rates, banks restricted agricultural lending. The British monetary system operated uniformly across England and Ireland under the Act. Cantwell's cabin—valued at just 5 shillings—was destroyed not by bad weather or personal failure, but by monetary policy embedded in law.²⁷ᵐ

**The empirical sequence proved chartalism**: Before tax, British currency circulated among colonists but Africans didn't adopt it. After tax imposed, currency adoption was forced legally. Tax obligation created currency demand. The irony: while London economists denied taxation drives currency value, colonial administrators proved it through documented coercion. They understood the principle through practice.²⁷ⁿ

The 1821 deflation had caused unnecessary suffering, destroyed livelihoods, and demonstrated that returning to gold at the old parity imposed arbitrary costs on debtors. Yet this lesson would be forgotten. A century later, Britain would repeat this mistake with even more devastating consequences—when Winston Churchill's 1925 return to gold at an overvalued parity would trigger mass unemployment, a general strike, and contribute to the global catastrophe that followed.

The gold standard era had reached its intellectual apex. What had been explicit in 1694—that the Bank of England created money "out of nothing"—was now unthinkable in respectable economics. The institutional reality of money creation had been buried beneath layers of gold fetishism and creditor-class ideology. But this very success contained the seeds of the system's destruction. The next time crisis came, the gold standard would not survive. Part IV examines how the breaking happened—and what it revealed about money's true nature.

**Yet the orthodoxy established in these decades—taxes must fund spending, gold backing is essential, fiscal discipline requires external constraints—would prove catastrophic when put to the ultimate test.** Within a generation, the very policies that Currency School economists championed as scientific necessity would help trigger the worst economic disasters in modern history. Churchill's 1925 return to gold at an overvalued parity would repeat the 1821 mistake with even more devastating consequences. France's gold hoarding would help cause the Great Depression. The Federal Reserve's adherence to Real Bills Doctrine orthodoxy would turn a financial panic into a global catastrophe. And in each case, the human cost—miners starving, farmers losing land, families destroyed—would be justified by the same rhetoric about sound money and fiscal responsibility that had marginalized Thomas Attwood and crushed the Chartist petition. The manufactured orthodoxy of 1820-1850 would kill millions in 1929-1939. Understanding how that happened—and why—is the subject of the next chapter.

And that manufactured orthodoxy explains why household budget metaphors still dominate policy debates 200 years after the gold standard ended. When politicians claim "we're out of money" or economists argue that deficits "crowd out" private investment, they're repeating arguments developed to serve creditor interests in the 1820s-1840s. The Real Bills Doctrine—thoroughly discredited by the Great Depression—still appears in modified form when central bankers claim they can't "print money" to finance government spending.

The Bank Charter Act's failure reveals a pattern that repeats in modern financial regulation: regulators fight the last war while banks innovate around restrictions. The Currency School tried to control note issuance, so banks shifted to creating deposits. Modern regulators focus on bank capital requirements, so finance migrates to shadow banking. The 2008 crisis demonstrated this perfectly—regulated banks were constrained, but money market funds, repo markets, and structured investment vehicles created money-like instruments outside regulatory oversight. You cannot control money creation by regulating one form while ignoring functionally equivalent alternatives.

The colonial hut tax evidence is particularly relevant. At the exact moment London economists were denying that taxation drives currency demand, British administrators in Africa were proving the principle through force. Colonial subjects resisted foreign currency until taxation made it necessary—empirical evidence that taxation creates currency demand, not the other way around. This supports Modern Monetary Theory's core insight: governments that issue their own currency don't need to collect taxes before spending. Taxes create demand for the currency, enabling government spending. The colonial administrators understood this intuitively; modern economists are still catching up.

Understanding how this orthodoxy was constructed helps us see that our current monetary constraints are political choices, not economic laws. The Currency School lost the intellectual debate but won the policy war. Their ideas, proven wrong by events, still shape how we think about money today. The household budget metaphor isn't common sense—it's creditor-class ideology that outlived the gold standard that supposedly justified it.

Yet the orthodoxy they built would face a test it could not survive: total war followed by catastrophic peace. The gold standard appeared triumphant in 1914, the foundation of international commerce and guarantor of monetary stability. But World War I would shatter gold's automatic adjustment. When Britain suspended convertibility in 1914, paper money again proved it could function without metal—just as it had during the Bank Restriction of 1797-1821. The disastrous attempt to restore gold at pre-war parities in the 1920s would vindicate every warning Thomas Attwood had made a century earlier. Churchill's 1925 return to gold would impose deflation on coal miners who had done nothing wrong except live under a monetary system serving creditor interests over human welfare. France and the United States would hoard gold, creating the deflationary shock that triggered the Great Depression. And when countries finally abandoned gold—Roosevelt in 1933, Britain in 1931—recovery would begin almost immediately. The breaking, when it came, would reveal what the gold standard's century of success had obscured: gold was never the foundation of monetary value. Trust was. And trust could be built without gold.

### The Victory of Orthodoxy—And Its Persistence Today

By 1850, the transformation was complete. The understanding that had been explicit in 1694—that the Bank of England created money "out of nothing" backed by parliamentary taxation—had become unthinkable in respectable economics. The manufactured orthodoxy that emerged between 1800-1850 still shapes monetary debates today, 173 years after the gold standard supposedly justified it disappeared.²⁷ᵖ

**What was forgotten:**

- **William Paterson's 1694 candor:** The Bank profits from creating money "out of nothing"
- **Adam Smith's 1776 insight:** Princes can give value to paper money through taxation
- **Bank Restriction 1797-1821:** Paper money worked for 24 years without gold backing, Britain won the Napoleonic Wars with fiat currency
- **Taxation's role:** Creating baseline currency demand independent of convertibility, proven empirically in colonial administration²⁷ᵍ

**What replaced it:**

- **Ricardo's Quantity Theory:** Money supply must be rigidly constrained by gold reserves
- **Say's Law:** Government spending can't address unemployment (general gluts are impossible)
- **Bank Charter Act 1844:** Gold backing made automatic through legislation, removing democratic choice
- **Household budget metaphor:** Government must "find money" before spending, treating sovereign currency issuers like currency users²⁷ʳ

The gold standard orthodoxy that Birmingham School had challenged, that Peel's 1844 Act had embedded in law, would reach its apotheosis in the early twentieth century. By 1913, nearly every major economy operated on gold. The system appeared eternal, natural, inevitable.

### Eight Decades of Gold—Then War

For eighty years after 1844, Peel's orthodoxy governed British monetary policy and spread across the globe. Between 1870 and 1914—the era historians call the gold standard's "golden age"—international trade flourished, empires expanded, and London finance dominated the world. By 1900, every major economy except China had adopted the gold standard. The system appeared to vindicate Currency School principles: automatic adjustment, price stability, fiscal discipline.

But the system's apparent success concealed structural fragilities. It worked because the Bank of England exercised discretionary management despite the Act's automatic rules, because no major wars disrupted trade, because British imperial power extracted resources from colonies to balance payments, because new gold discoveries in South Africa and Alaska prevented deflation. The automatic mechanism Peel celebrated was actually managed flexibility hiding behind gold's facade.

When war came in August 1914, gold's constraints became intolerable. Every combatant—Britain, France, Germany, Russia—abandoned the gold standard within days to finance mass mobilization. The system that had seemed eternal collapsed in a week. Paper money again proved it could function without gold backing, just as it had during the Bank Restriction of 1797-1821.

By 1918, the question facing the world's central bankers was not whether to return to gold, but whether return was even possible. Prices had doubled or tripled during the war. Gold reserves were depleted. Yet the men who controlled monetary policy—raised on Peel's orthodoxy, educated in Currency School economics—could imagine no alternative. In 1925, Winston Churchill would make the fateful choice to restore Britain's prewar gold parity. The consequences would be catastrophic, vindicating every warning Thomas Attwood had made a century earlier.

The manufactured orthodoxy was now complete. What had been controversial in 1821, contested in 1844, had become unquestionable by 1918. The Banking School's warnings were forgotten. Attwood's insights were dismissed as the ravings of cranks. Gold was treated not as policy choice but as natural law—the only conceivable foundation for monetary order. And when the system's contradictions finally exploded, the human cost would be measured not in thousands but in millions. Coal miners would starve while defending an overvalued currency. Farmers would lose land their families had worked for generations, foreclosed by deflation that served distant creditors. France would cling to gold while workers froze in métro entrances. The orthodoxy that claimed to prevent crises would instead cause the worst economic collapse in modern history. Part IV traces how the breaking happened—and what it revealed about the lies we'd been told about money's true nature.
