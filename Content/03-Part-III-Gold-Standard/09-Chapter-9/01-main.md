# Chapter 9: Manufacturing Orthodoxy

## The Paradox of Intellectual Defeat and Legislative Victory

In September 1843, James Wilson founded *The Economist* magazine to promote free trade and argue for monetary reform. Week after week, the magazine attacked the Currency School's rigid doctrines. Wilson published sophisticated critiques of the proposed Bank Charter Act, warning that it would fail to control credit creation. When Robert Torrens, a Currency School defender, published his rebuttal in 1848, the title told the story: *The Principles and Practical Operation of Sir Robert Peel's Bill of 1844 Explained, and Defended Against the Objections of Tooke, Fullarton, and Wilson*. Wilson was grouped with Thomas Tooke and John Fullarton—the Banking School's leading theorists—as an opponent requiring systematic refutation.¹

Yet on July 19, 1844, the Bank Charter Act received Royal Assent with overwhelming parliamentary support. Wilson's Economist, Tooke's theoretical treatises, Fullarton's detailed critiques—all had failed. The Currency School had won completely. Not because they controlled the press (they demonstrably didn't), not because they silenced opposition (Banking School voices remained prominent), but because they captured the institution that mattered: **Parliament**.²

This reveals something crucial about how economic orthodoxy gets manufactured. It's not always about controlling all channels of discourse. Sometimes it's about controlling the decisive channel—the one that translates ideas into law. The Banking School had intellectual sophistication, prominent advocates, and access to influential publications. They lost anyway. Understanding how reveals that monetary orthodoxy isn't discovered through neutral inquiry—it's enacted through institutional power.³

The transformation from 1694 understanding (the Bank creates money "out of nothing") to 1850 orthodoxy (taxes must fund spending) didn't happen by accident. It was manufactured through institutional power that embedded Currency School doctrine into the architecture of British economic life. Understanding **how** this erasure happened reveals that monetary orthodoxy is ideological construction, not natural economic law.⁴

## The Parliamentary Triumph: The Bank Charter Act of 1844

### Peel's May 6, 1844 Speech: Defining Money as Gold

Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel opened the debate on May 6, 1844, by defining the pound as "a certain definite quantity of gold"—not an abstract unit, not a promise backed by taxation, but physical metal. Everything else, he argued, was delusion.⁵

This Currency School doctrine made alternatives literally unthinkable. What William Paterson had stated in 1694—that the Bank creates money "out of nothing"—was now conceptually impossible. What Adam Smith wrote in 1776 about princes giving value to paper money through taxation might as well have never been written. The Bank Restriction period (1797-1821), when Britain financed the Napoleonic Wars with unbacked paper, was recast as dangerous aberration rather than proof fiat currency could work.⁶

### The Mechanism: Automatic Gold Standard

Peel's system removed monetary policy from political contestation. The Bank would split into two departments: Issue (creating notes backed by gold) and Banking (ordinary business). Note issuance above £14 million would be "governed in amount by the fluctuations in the stock of bullion"—automatically rising and falling with gold reserves.⁷

The elegance served creditor interests perfectly. When gold flowed out, the money supply automatically contracted—no parliamentary debate, no democratic choice, no employment considerations. The contraction triggered deflation, raising bond values and protecting creditors' returns. All presented as natural economic law, not political choice.⁸

Peel argued that "unlimited competition" in note issuance wouldn't secure proper currency regulation—the metallic standard required centralized control.⁹ The Act would therefore prohibit new banks from issuing notes, freeze existing country banks' issuance at 1844 levels, and eliminate note-issuing rights upon merger. By economic attrition rather than direct ban, private note issuance would disappear over decades.¹⁰

### Peel's Twenty-Five Year Arc

Peel framed the 1844 Act as completing work begun in 1819, when he helped "terminate inconvertible paper currency" and restore the gold standard.¹¹ This established continuity: the 1819 Resumption Act (triggering the devastating 1821 deflation) and the 1844 Bank Charter Act were chapters in the same story—returning Britain to gold orthodoxy and keeping it there permanently. Peel's political authority lent Currency School theory the weight of statesmanship.¹²

### The Banking School Opposition: Prophetic Warnings

**Benjamin Hawes**, Member of Parliament for Lambeth, led the opposition on June 13, 1844, arguing there was no evidence to justify interfering with banks' note issuance.¹³

Hawes made the Banking School's core argument: if bank notes can be converted to gold on demand, that convertibility already provides sufficient safeguard. "There is an adequate and sufficient check upon the issues of bank notes," he argued—Peel's additional restrictions were unnecessary.¹⁴

He challenged the Currency School's central claim head-on: where was the proof that convertible paper money caused high prices? After searching committee evidence and testimony, Hawes found no examples actually linking convertible bank notes to inflation. The Currency School was legislating based on theory, not evidence.¹⁵

Most remarkably, Hawes predicted exactly what would happen—and was ignored. Restrict the legal currency below what the economy actually needs, he warned, and people will find alternatives: "the necessity for a circulating medium of some kind will prove too strong for your legislation, and will lead to a system of dealing in small bills and acceptances."¹⁶

This prediction proved devastatingly accurate. The Act was suspended during crises in 1847, 1857, and 1866. And credit did find alternative forms—through bills of exchange, and most importantly, through the deposits the Currency School had failed to recognize as money.¹⁷

**Mr. Hastie** warned the plan would cause catastrophic collapse: "There would be such an utter collapse in so short a period, that it must be plain to every man of experience that no bank in London could stand it; no merchant in London could stand it."¹⁸

**Charles Newdegate** spoke for agricultural interests: price reductions from currency contraction hit workers hardest—"a sheer loss without the shadow of an equivalent."¹⁹

### What Wasn't Debated: The Chartalist Alternative

Remarkably, no MP cited Adam Smith's 1776 insight that princes could give value to paper money through taxation. No one referenced the Bank Restriction period (1797-1821) as evidence that paper money could work without gold backing—except Hawes, who cited Deacon Hume's observation that "England was the cheapest country in the world" during the period when gold was 25% above mint price, and was promptly ignored.²⁰

The idea that William Paterson had articulated in 1694—that the Bank creates money "out of nothing"—was now unspeakable in Parliament. The Banking School's objections focused on whether credit or notes mattered more, accepting the Currency School's premise that gold backing was necessary. The chartalist understanding had been so thoroughly erased that it didn't even appear as an option to be rejected.²¹

### Overwhelming Victory

Though no recorded division lists survive for the Act's key votes, the debates make clear the bill enjoyed overwhelming support. Banking School opposition speakers acknowledged their minority status. The controversy was not primarily partisan but intellectual—Currency School versus Banking School monetary theories—with both Conservatives and Liberals on each side.²²

Chancellor of the Exchequer Henry Goulburn noted that the measure "had consequently met with the concurrence of those who had attended to the Committee [1840-41], who had heard all the objections that could be urged against it, and had heard all the advantages that might be expected from it."²³

The Currency School had won—not by silencing opposition, but by controlling the institution that translated theory into law.

## The Intellectual Architecture: Lord Overstone's Shadow

Though absent from parliamentary speeches (he was not an MP), **Samuel Jones Loyd** (1796-1883)—later Baron Overstone—served as the Bank Charter Act's true architect. His testimony before the 1840 Select Committee on Banks of Issue and his published works established Currency School doctrine:

- *Reflections Suggested by a Perusal of Mr. J. Horsley Palmer's Pamphlet* (1837)
- *Further Reflections on the State of the Currency* (1837)
- *Remarks on the Management of the Circulation* (1840)
- *Thoughts on the Separation of the Departments of the Bank of England* (1844)²⁴

An 1857 parliamentary debate explicitly acknowledged his authorship: "The noble Lord opposite (Lord Overstone) **one of its chief promoters, and generally supposed to be its author**, upon the question of the note circulation keeping pace with the increase or decrease of gold, said— 'The issues of the Bank of England will, under the provisions of that Bill, be made to conform strictly to the fluctuations of the bullion.'"²⁵

Loyd's influence operated through ideas and evidence, not position. He didn't need parliamentary office—Peel's political authority enacted Loyd's intellectual framework.

## The Academic Presence: Oxford's Drummond Chair

The Currency School's ideas circulated prominently in British universities, though the documentary evidence for deliberate "curriculum capture" is more ambiguous than often assumed.

**Nassau William Senior** (1790-1864) served as inaugural Drummond Professor of Political Economy at Oxford (1825-1830), then returned for a second term (1847-1852)—precisely the period when the Bank Charter Act was debated and enacted. During his tenure, Senior published extensively on monetary topics:

- *Three Lectures on the Cost of obtaining Money, and on some Effects of Private and Government Paper Money* (1830)
- *An Outline of the Science of Political Economy* (1836), compiled from his Oxford lectures²⁶

Senior's *Outline* exercised wide influence among classical economists. Yet a critical evidentiary gap remains: **no surviving examination papers from Oxford political economy courses in the 1820s-1850s period have been located**. No university calendars list required texts. No course syllabi specify whether students were taught Currency School orthodoxy to the exclusion of Banking School views.²⁷

What we can document: Senior held Oxford's prestigious Drummond Professorship during both the Currency School's rise (1825-30) and its legislative triumph (1847-52). He published on monetary topics during both terms. His works circulated widely among the educated class.

What we cannot conclusively demonstrate: That Oxford systematically taught Currency School doctrine while excluding Banking School alternatives, or that examination questions tested students on gold orthodoxy as established fact.²⁸

The religious tests (subscription to the Thirty-Nine Articles) served as Oxford and Cambridge's primary academic gatekeepers during this period, not economic doctrine. The controversy centered on admitting Nonconformists and Catholics, not on monetary theory.²⁹

At Cambridge, **George Pryme** began teaching political economy in 1816—nine years before Oxford's Drummond Chair was established—and was formally recognized as Professor of Political Economy in 1828. **John Stuart Mill's** *Principles of Political Economy* (1848) achieved immediate dominance as the political economy textbook, running through seven editions during Mill's lifetime and continuing in use at Oxford "until 1919."³⁰

Mill's *Principles* engaged both Currency and Banking School arguments, though ultimately accepting the gold standard premise. The text became orthodox, but it wasn't a pure Currency School manifesto—it was a synthesis that acknowledged debates while reinforcing gold's necessity.³¹

**Assessment:** Currency School figures held prestigious academic positions and their works dominated teaching. But the "smoking gun" evidence of orchestrated curriculum capture—examination papers testing gold orthodoxy, textbook lists excluding Banking School works, documented cases of heterodox economists denied positions—remains elusive. The evidence is consistent with Currency School institutional presence but doesn't conclusively establish deliberate ideological control of universities.³²

## A Victim Who Understood: Harold Heslop's Story

The manufactured orthodoxy didn't just harm workers in abstract ways—it destroyed specific lives that we can document. Harold Heslop's trajectory reveals how the Bank Charter Act of 1844 had consequences that rippled through generations.

**Harold Heslop** (1898-1983) was born into a multi-generational mining family in Hunwick, County Durham. At age 13, in 1911, he started work at Boulby ironstone mine. Later he worked at Harton Colliery, South Shields, becoming secretary of his local Independent Labour Party branch and a Durham Miners' Association council representative. His political consciousness and organizing skills earned him a scholarship to Central Labour College in London, where he studied from 1923 to 1926—the exact period when Winston Churchill made his fateful decision to return Britain to gold at the pre-war parity.³³

Heslop returned to Harton Colliery in 1926, witnessing the General Strike firsthand. On March 27, 1926, he married Phyllis Hannah Varndell, a clerk at Selfridges, three months before the strike began. **In late 1927, as the coal industry contracted under the pressure of the overvalued pound, Heslop was made unemployed.** He remained unemployed thereafter, eventually moving to London.³⁴

But Heslop did what the orthodoxy's architects had prevented Thomas Attwood from doing: he documented the experience for posterity. His novels transformed lived suffering into literary testimony:

- *Goaf* (1926 in Russian, 1934 in English) about northern England mining
- *The Gate of a Strange Field* (1929) about the 1926 General Strike
- *Last Cage Down* (1935) and *The Earth Beneath* (1946) about Durham's coalfields
- Posthumous autobiography *Out of the Old Earth* (1994) with "rich recollections of childhood in the coalfield... fine descriptions of working life above and below ground"³⁵

**As a Central Labour College graduate, Heslop likely understood the broader economic forces** better than most miners. He had studied political economy, labor history, and organizing strategy. Yet he couldn't escape the consequences of policies embedded in law 83 years before his unemployment. The Bank Charter Act of 1844 had institutionalized monetary contraction that required gold backing. When Churchill returned to gold at an overvalued parity in 1925, he triggered the mechanism that the Currency School had built: automatic deflation, industrial contraction, mass unemployment.³⁶

Heslop's papers remain at Durham University Special Collections (reference GB-0033-HES), a documentary archive of one man's attempt to tell the story that orthodox economics had erased. The manufactured orthodoxy of the 1840s claimed its victims through the 1920s-1930s—and some of them wrote it down.³⁷

## Why Institutional Capture Through Legislation Worked

The Currency School's triumph reveals a crucial pattern: **you don't need to control all discourse to manufacture orthodoxy—you need to control the decisive institution**.

**What the Banking School Had:**
- Prominent voices (Thomas Tooke, John Fullarton, James Wilson)
- Sophisticated theoretical arguments
- Access to influential publications (*The Economist*, academic treatises)
- Parliamentary representation (Benjamin Hawes and allies)
- Prophetic warnings that proved correct (credit would evade note restrictions)³⁸

**What the Currency School Had:**
- The Prime Minister's political authority (Peel)
- The intellectual architecture (Lord Overstone's systematic framework)
- The 1840 Select Committee's evidentiary foundation
- Timing (coming off the 1837 crisis)
- **And most critically: The votes to pass legislation**³⁹

The Banking School lost not because they were silenced but because their influence operated in channels that didn't translate into law. *The Economist* could publish critiques every week. Tooke and Fullarton could write treatises. Hawes could warn in Parliament. None of it mattered once Peel's bill passed.⁴⁰

The pattern repeats throughout history: **legislative capture trumps intellectual debate**. The Currency School embedded their principles into automatic law—when gold flowed out, money contracted, triggering deflation without further democratic input. The Banking School could write all the articles they wanted; the law enacted Currency School doctrine regardless.⁴¹

And when the Act had to be suspended during crises (1847, 1857, 1866), proving the Banking School right? The Act was reinstated afterward. Even empirical failure couldn't dislodge orthodoxy once it was embedded in legislation and enforced through state power.⁴²

The interest alignment explains why the orthodoxy persisted despite repeated failure. Deflation increased bondholders' real returns. Gold constraints limited government spending that might threaten property rights. Financial mystification made banking seem like natural intermediation rather than state-sanctioned credit expansion. The orthodoxy served concentrated interests while claiming universal benefit—and those interests had the political power to maintain it through legislative force.⁴³

## Colonial Proof: Taxation Drives Money Through Force

[EXISTING CONTENT FROM LINES 304-333 - Colonial hut tax section - KEEP AS IS]

**Why This History Matters Now:**

You've just read about how Parliament embedded creditor-friendly monetary orthodoxy into British law while prominent voices opposed it. The Banking School had sophisticated arguments, influential publications, and parliamentary representation—yet they lost because the Currency School controlled the decisive institution.

This pattern operates today. When the European Central Bank's statutes prohibit monetary financing of government deficits, that's legislative capture embedding creditor interests into automatic law—exactly like the Bank Charter Act's gold rules. When "central bank independence" is enshrined in law, insulating monetary policy from democratic pressure, that's the modern equivalent of Peel's "automatic" gold standard. When think tanks produce "research" showing government debt is unsustainable while ignoring unused productive capacity, that's contemporary *Economist*-style manufacture of orthodoxy.⁴⁴

The key insight: monetary orthodoxy isn't discovered; it's constructed. It serves specific interests (creditors, wealth-holders, financial institutions) while claiming universal benefit. Recognizing this pattern helps us evaluate contemporary fiscal debates skeptically: when someone claims a policy is "economically necessary," ask who benefits from that necessity being accepted as fact.⁴⁵

[TRANSITION TO NEXT SECTION: Peel's Unintended Consequence - EXISTING CONTENT FROM LINE 250 ONWARDS]
### Peel's unintended consequence: The birth of modern banking

The Bank Charter Act of 1844 represents one of history's great unintended consequences. Robert Peel and the Currency School economists crafted legislation to end fractional reserve banking and establish 100% gold backing for new note issuance. They succeeded in destroying private note issuance. They utterly failed to control credit creation. The Act **prohibited new banks from issuing notes** anywhere in Britain, froze existing country banks' issuance at 1844 levels, and mandated that banks would **lose note-issuing rights upon merger**. Combined with the requirement that new Bank of England notes be backed 100% by gold (above a £14 million fiduciary issue), Peel believed he had ended monetary inflation caused by excessive bank credit.²⁷ʰ

The mechanism worked through economic attrition rather than direct prohibition. In 1844, **277 country banks issued £8.6 million in notes** compared to £21 million from the Bank of England. Unable to expand note circulation as the economy grew, note issuance became increasingly unprofitable for country banks. When banks merged—and industrialization accelerated merger activity—note privileges lapsed and transferred to the Bank of England. By 1880, only 157 banks issued notes worth barely £6 million. By 1914, just 11 banks issued £401,719. **Fox, Fowler and Company issued the last private English banknote in 1921**, completing a 77-year transition to Bank of England monopoly.²⁷ⁱ

But the Currency School made what critics would call a "tragic error": they assumed bank deposits weren't money. They focused obsessively on paper notes while ignoring checking accounts and deposit transfers. The Act "only stopped the creation of paper bank notes—it didn't refer to other substitutes for money, such as bank deposits." Banks immediately pivoted. As monetary historian Charles Goodhart writes, "Both the Bank of England and the country banks, deprived of the right to issue notes at will, began to issue deposits to a fare-thee-well." **Fractional reserve banking didn't end in England after 1844; it simply changed to focusing on demand deposits instead of notes**.²⁷ʲ

### The intellectual blind spot: Why economists couldn't see deposits

The Currency School's error wasn't mere oversight—it reflected a profound intellectual blind spot that extended to the most brilliant economists of the Victorian era. Even those who understood banking intimately failed to grasp that deposit creation was functionally identical to note issuance. This wasn't ignorance but conceptual blindness: the inability to see that accounting entries could create money just as effectively as printing presses.

Victorian economists faced a conceptual barrier: they could see physical banknotes as money but viewed deposit entries as merely records of money, not money itself. They were wrong. When a bank wrote "+£5" next to a customer's name, that accounting entry *was* money—identical in function to a £5 note, enabling the customer to buy goods, pay debts, and transfer value. Money had to be a tangible *thing*, they believed—not invisible ledger entries. This blindness led to history's greatest regulatory failure: meticulously controlling visible banknotes while ignoring functionally identical invisible deposits.

**John Stuart Mill** (1848) acknowledged deposits operated "exactly parallel" to bank notes yet denied credit could "make something out of nothing"—precisely wrong, since loans literally create deposits. **Walter Bagehot**, despite writing the definitive 1873 guide to deposit banking, believed "banks cannot create money"—they merely lend out deposits. The error persisted because from any individual bank's perspective it looks like intermediation, but system-wide, loans create deposits that enable more loans. The system-level reality—money creation through lending—was invisible to observers focused on individual banks.²⁷ᵖ⁻ᵍᵃ

Not until **Keynes's *Treatise on Money* (1930)** do we find explicit recognition of what was actually happening. Keynes wrote: "It is evident that there is no limit to the amount of bank money which the banks can safely create provided that they move forward in step." Banks create deposits by buying assets or making loans. The money doesn't exist before the loan—the loan creates it. Yet even Keynes retreated from this clarity. His 1936 *General Theory*, the work that reshaped economics, adopted a more ambiguous treatment of money and banking. The brief moment of clarity in the *Treatise* gave way to formulations that could be interpreted as traditional intermediation. The confusion would persist for another half-century.²⁷ʳ

The full articulation awaited the Post-Keynesian revival of the 1970s-1980s. **Basil Moore's 1988 book** *Horizontalists and Verticalists* systematically explained the mechanism: "loans create deposits"—the reverse of the textbook sequence. Banks accommodate creditworthy demand for loans. When they lend, they create deposits. Central banks then supply whatever reserves banks need to settle payments between each other, setting the interest rate rather than controlling the quantity. Money supply is endogenous—determined by loan demand, not by central bank policy or reserve constraints. Moore was building on earlier Post-Keynesian work by Nicholas Kaldor and Hyman Minsky, but his 1988 synthesis finally made the argument comprehensive and irrefutable.²⁷ˢ

Why did it take so long? **The intellectual investment in the wrong model was enormous**. The "loanable funds" theory—banks as intermediaries between savers and borrowers—anchored entire edifices of economic theory. Interest rates were supposed to equilibrate saving and investment. Central banks were supposed to control money supply through reserve requirements. The money multiplier provided neat mathematical exercises for undergraduate textbooks. Admitting that banks create money by lending would require rebuilding monetary economics from the foundation.²⁷ᵗ

More profoundly, **deposit creation was invisible**. When a country bank printed a £5 note and handed it to a borrower, everyone could see new money entering circulation—a physical object that hadn't existed before now passed from hand to hand. But when a bank creates a £5 deposit by writing "+£5" in a ledger next to a customer's name, nothing physical changes. The money exists only as an accounting entry, a promise to pay on demand. Victorian economists could see notes and gold—tangible objects that seemed to obey physical laws of conservation. They couldn't see ledger entries the same way, couldn't grasp that accounting could create purchasing power as effectively as minting coins.²⁷ᵘ

This wasn't mere academic confusion—it was **the greatest regulatory failure in banking history**. Currency School economists regulated the visible (notes) while ignoring the invisible (deposits). The 1844 Act meticulously controlled paper currency—100% gold backing, frozen limits, lapsed privileges upon merger. Deposit banking operated unconstrained—no reserve requirements, no capital requirements, no limits. Banks simply shifted from notes to deposits, continuing fractional reserve money creation through a new medium.²⁷ᵛ

Banks exploited this regulatory blind spot for seven decades. As note issuance became unprofitable and restricted, banks pivoted to deposits. The Scottish banks provide a telling example: after the 1845 Bank Notes (Scotland) Act capped their note circulation, they "shifted to deposits" to maintain profitability. English joint-stock banks, barred from London note issuance, built their business models around deposit creation from the start. By 1900, deposits utterly dominated the money supply—99.91% of transactions by value. The mechanism that country banks had used with notes—lending creates money, constrained only by confidence and redemption demands—simply moved underground into deposit banking, where it operated with even less oversight than note issuance had faced.²⁷ʷ

The irony compounds: while Currency School doctrine demanded 100% gold backing for notes to prevent inflation, banks were creating deposits worth many times their gold reserves—the precise "overissue" the Act was designed to prevent, just in accounting form rather than printed paper. Peel had won the battle (note control) while losing the war (credit control). The Currency School's intellectual triumph enabled the

 expansion they feared, simply by failing to recognize that the enemy had changed uniforms.²⁷ˣ

The transformation was dramatic: by the twentieth century, bank deposits constituted **99.91% of transactions by value**. Peel had banned visible private money while accidentally authorizing invisible private money creation on unprecedented scale—the same fractional reserve mechanism, now in deposit form, but without the regulatory constraints imposed on notes.²⁷ᵏ

The United States followed a parallel trajectory. The National Banking Acts (1863-1864) imposed a **10% tax on state bank notes**, making their issuance uneconomical. State bank note circulation "fell from $143 million in 1865 to $4 million by 1867"—effectively eliminated through punitive taxation rather than direct ban. But state banks discovered the same workaround as English banks: deposits. "By the 1880s, deposit accounts had changed the primary source of revenue for many banks," and "by the 1890s, **90% of the money supply was in checking accounts**." Individual deposits grew from 5% to 23% of GDP between 1863 and 1913, with deposits rising from 96% to 592% of bank capital. State banking made a dramatic comeback through deposit creation, which faced no equivalent tax.²⁷ˡ

What emerged on both sides of the Atlantic was the modern two-tier monetary system: **central bank base money (reserves and currency) at the foundation, with commercial banks creating deposit money on top**. The Bank of England and later the Federal Reserve (1913) provided reserves—the settlement medium banks needed to clear payments with each other. Commercial banks created deposits through lending, multiplying the money supply far beyond the base. The hierarchy that had existed informally when country banks pyramided notes on Bank of England reserves was now formalized: banks needed central bank reserves for settlement, but they created most circulating money through deposit expansion.²⁷ᵐ

The Currency School's failure to understand this mechanism reveals a profound truth about money: **the form matters less than the function**. Whether money circulates as paper notes or electronic deposits, the mechanism is the same—banks create purchasing power by lending, constrained not by reserves but by demand for credit and confidence in the banking system. Peel's Act tried to control money by controlling its physical form. But money is not a thing; it is a relationship, a ledger entry, a promise. Changing the medium from notes to deposits didn't eliminate private money creation—it merely made it invisible, operating through accounting entries rather than printed paper.²⁷ⁿ

The irony is complete: the Act designed to establish state control over money creation instead **perfected private money creation** by driving it underground into deposit banking, where it would operate with even less oversight for the next century. The principle that William Paterson had articulated in 1694—that the Bank "hath benefit of interest on all moneys which it creates out of nothing"—remained true. Only now, hundreds of commercial banks were creating money out of nothing through deposit expansion, and the Currency School's legislative triumph had made this process less visible and less regulated than the note issuance it replaced.²⁷ᵒ

The transformation was complete. Within 50 years of Adam Smith's explicit statement that princes could give value to paper money through taxation, such ideas had become nearly unspeakable. The gold standard's success—its century of apparent stability from 1821 to 1914—would cement this false narrative so deeply that even its collapse in the 20th century would not fully dislodge it. The household budget metaphor, the idea that governments must "find the money" before they can spend, would persist long after the gold that supposedly justified it had disappeared from the monetary system.²⁷ʰ

---

Scotland's "free banking" era (1716-1845) is often cited as proof that private money doesn't need state foundation. But this dissolves upon examination. Scottish banks operated entirely within British state frameworks—parliamentary charters, British common law enforcement, settlement in Bank of England notes, and access to the Bank as informal lender of last resort. The lesson: **private innovation and public foundation are complements, not substitutes**. Scotland's success required British legal institutions, monetary framework, and crisis backstops.²⁷ʸ ²⁸¹ ²⁸⁴

### Colonial proof: Taxation drives money through force

While 19th-century orthodoxy denied that taxation drives currency adoption, colonial administrators demonstrated this principle empirically through systematic coercion. The historical record provides the clearest evidence for the chartalist principle—precisely because colonial powers couldn't rely on market mechanisms and had to use force.²⁷ⁱ

**British colonial hut taxes** were explicitly designed to force currency adoption. The Natal Colony's 1849 hut tax eventually contributed 75% of all revenues. By the 1890s-1910s, Kenya, Uganda, Rhodesia, Gambia, Nyasaland, and Mashonaland had all implemented hut or poll taxes **payable only in colonial currency**. As documented in the Rhodesian Study Circle records: "It was variously payable in money, labour, grain or stock and benefited the colonial authorities in four related ways: it raised money; **it supported the currency; it broadened the cash economy, aiding further development; and it forced Africans to labour in the colonial economy**."²⁷ʲ

Historian Martin Daunton writes: **"Could revenue rise sufficiently unless Africans were forced into a commercialized and monetized economy that produced taxable goods and incomes to meet tax liabilities? And could crops be grown for the market, or mines developed, unless a waged labour force was created? Such considerations led to an increased reliance on the hut tax as a means of forcing economic and social change."**²⁷ᵏ

The mechanism was explicit: "Households which had survived on cattle ranching now sent members to work for the colonialists to raise cash for the tax." Kenya's Hut Tax (1901) and Poll Tax (1910) **"forced Africans into wage labor, as they needed cash to pay these levies."**²⁷ˡ

The Kenya case provides stark documentary evidence.²⁷ˡ⁻¹ Before 1901, Kenyan communities used cattle wealth, barter, and regional trade. British rupees circulated among settlers but Africans rarely used them. The 1901 Hut Tax Ordinance changed everything: 2-3 rupees per hut annually, **payable only in British currency**. No cattle, no crops, no labor—only rupees.²⁷ˡ⁻³ Families faced two options: sell to settlers for rupees, or send members to wage labor on colonial plantations. Both accomplished the objective: forcing participation in the colonial cash economy.

**Enforcement was brutal.** Colonial registers tracked non-payment. Penalties included property confiscation (especially cattle—traditional wealth stores), forced labor, imprisonment, home destruction.²⁷ˡ⁻⁶ Lord Lugard's *Political Memoranda* openly described taxation as "educating Africans into Anglo-Saxon economic values"—coercion disguised as civilization.²⁷ˡ⁻⁸

**Resistance was widespread and violent**: the Hut Tax War (Sierra Leone, 1898), First Chimurenga (Rhodesia, 1896-97), Bambatha Rebellion (South Africa, 1905). Military force crushed opposition, then taxation compelled currency adoption.²⁷ˡ⁻⁹

**The empirical sequence proved chartalism:**

1. Before tax: British currency available but not adopted
2. Tax imposed: Currency adoption forced legally  
3. Mechanism: Tax obligation creates currency demand
4. Result: Currency circulates, monetized economy emerges²⁷ˡ⁻¹¹

**The devastating irony:** While London economists denied taxation drives currency value, British colonial administrators proved it through documented coercion. They understood the principle through practice: declaring "pay taxes in rupees" created rupee demand, regardless of commodity backing or market history.²⁷ˡ⁻¹³

French colonial administrators were equally candid. Scholar Ndongo Samba Sylla documents: "African people had for a long time **resisted the imposition of the French currency**... They were aware that **the acceptance of the colonial currency would disrupt their trade and more importantly would make them economically subordinated to the diktats of their colonial masters**... **As the ban on the import of cowries and the obligation to pay taxes in the colonial currency were not always effective, colonial administrators were often obliged to use legal sanctions and physical force.**"²⁷ᵐ

The widespread resistance—the Hut Tax War (Sierra Leone, 1898), Bambatha Rebellion (South Africa, 1905), First Chimurenga (Rhodesia, 1896-97), Mau Mau Uprising (Kenya, 1952)—demonstrates these taxes' coercive nature. Currency adoption was imposed, not voluntary market-driven evolution. Lord Lugard's Political Memoranda acknowledged taxation was "a means of **educating the Africans into Anglo-Saxon virtues and economic values**"—revealing that colonial powers fully understood taxation's role in forcing currency adoption and economic transformation.²⁷ⁿ

The colonial evidence is damning. At the very moment that respectable economics in London denied that taxation drives currency demand, British administrators in Africa were proving the principle through force. The disconnect reveals the ideological nature of 19th-century monetary orthodoxy: it was not based on empirical observation but on protecting creditor interests and maintaining fiscal discipline that served the wealthy.²⁷ᵒ

The 1821 deflation had caused unnecessary suffering, destroyed livelihoods, and demonstrated that returning to gold at the old parity imposed arbitrary costs on debtors. Yet this lesson would be forgotten. A century later, Britain would repeat this mistake with even more devastating consequences—when Winston Churchill's 1925 return to gold at an overvalued parity would trigger mass unemployment, a general strike, and contribute to the global catastrophe that followed.

The gold standard era had reached its intellectual apex. What had been explicit in 1694—that the Bank of England created money "out of nothing"—was now unthinkable in respectable economics. The institutional reality of money creation had been buried beneath layers of gold fetishism and creditor-class ideology. But this very success contained the seeds of the system's destruction. The next time crisis came, the gold standard would not survive. Part IV examines how the breaking happened—and what it revealed about money's true nature.

**Yet the orthodoxy established in these decades—taxes must fund spending, gold backing is essential, fiscal discipline requires external constraints—would prove catastrophic when put to the ultimate test.** Within a generation, the very policies that Currency School economists championed as scientific necessity would help trigger the worst economic disasters in modern history. Churchill's 1925 return to gold at an overvalued parity would repeat the 1821 mistake with even more devastating consequences. France's gold hoarding would help cause the Great Depression. The Federal Reserve's adherence to Real Bills Doctrine orthodoxy would turn a financial panic into a global catastrophe. And in each case, the human cost—miners starving, farmers losing land, families destroyed—would be justified by the same rhetoric about sound money and fiscal responsibility that had marginalized Thomas Attwood and crushed the Chartist petition. The manufactured orthodoxy of 1820-1850 would kill millions in 1929-1939. Understanding how that happened—and why—is the subject of the next chapter.

And that manufactured orthodoxy explains why household budget metaphors still dominate policy debates 200 years after the gold standard ended. When politicians claim "we're out of money" or economists argue that deficits "crowd out" private investment, they're repeating arguments developed to serve creditor interests in the 1820s-1840s. The Real Bills Doctrine—thoroughly discredited by the Great Depression—still appears in modified form when central bankers claim they can't "print money" to finance government spending.

The Bank Charter Act's failure reveals a pattern that repeats in modern financial regulation: regulators fight the last war while banks innovate around restrictions. The Currency School tried to control note issuance, so banks shifted to creating deposits. Modern regulators focus on bank capital requirements, so finance migrates to shadow banking. The 2008 crisis demonstrated this perfectly—regulated banks were constrained, but money market funds, repo markets, and structured investment vehicles created money-like instruments outside regulatory oversight. You cannot control money creation by regulating one form while ignoring functionally equivalent alternatives.

The colonial hut tax evidence is particularly relevant. At the exact moment London economists were denying that taxation drives currency demand, British administrators in Africa were proving the principle through force. Colonial subjects resisted foreign currency until taxation made it necessary—empirical evidence that taxation creates currency demand, not the other way around. This supports Modern Monetary Theory's core insight: governments that issue their own currency don't need to collect taxes before spending. Taxes create demand for the currency, enabling government spending. The colonial administrators understood this intuitively; modern economists are still catching up.

Understanding how this orthodoxy was constructed helps us see that our current monetary constraints are political choices, not economic laws. The Currency School lost the intellectual debate but won the policy war. Their ideas, proven wrong by events, still shape how we think about money today. The household budget metaphor isn't common sense—it's creditor-class ideology that outlived the gold standard that supposedly justified it.

Yet the orthodoxy they built would face a test it could not survive: total war followed by catastrophic peace. The gold standard appeared triumphant in 1914, the foundation of international commerce and guarantor of monetary stability. But World War I would shatter gold's automatic adjustment. When Britain suspended convertibility in 1914, paper money again proved it could function without metal—just as it had during the Bank Restriction of 1797-1821. The disastrous attempt to restore gold at pre-war parities in the 1920s would vindicate every warning Thomas Attwood had made a century earlier. Churchill's 1925 return to gold would impose deflation on coal miners who had done nothing wrong except live under a monetary system serving creditor interests over human welfare. France and the United States would hoard gold, creating the deflationary shock that triggered the Great Depression. And when countries finally abandoned gold—Roosevelt in 1933, Britain in 1931—recovery would begin almost immediately. The breaking, when it came, would reveal what the gold standard's century of success had obscured: gold was never the foundation of monetary value. Trust was. And trust could be built without gold.

### The Victory of Orthodoxy—And Its Persistence Today

By 1850, the transformation was complete. The understanding that had been explicit in 1694—that the Bank of England created money "out of nothing" backed by parliamentary taxation—had become unthinkable in respectable economics. The manufactured orthodoxy that emerged between 1800-1850 still shapes monetary debates today, 173 years after the gold standard supposedly justified it disappeared.²⁷ᵖ

**What was forgotten:**

- **William Paterson's 1694 candor:** The Bank profits from creating money "out of nothing"
- **Adam Smith's 1776 insight:** Princes can give value to paper money through taxation
- **Bank Restriction 1797-1821:** Paper money worked for 24 years without gold backing, Britain won the Napoleonic Wars with fiat currency
- **Taxation's role:** Creating baseline currency demand independent of convertibility, proven empirically in colonial administration²⁷ᵍ

**What replaced it:**

- **Ricardo's Quantity Theory:** Money supply must be rigidly constrained by gold reserves
- **Say's Law:** Government spending can't address unemployment (general gluts are impossible)
- **Bank Charter Act 1844:** Gold backing made automatic through legislation, removing democratic choice
- **Household budget metaphor:** Government must "find money" before spending, treating sovereign currency issuers like currency users²⁷ʳ

The gold standard orthodoxy that Birmingham School had challenged, that Peel's 1844 Act had embedded in law, would reach its apotheosis in the early twentieth century. By 1913, nearly every major economy operated on gold. The system appeared eternal, natural, inevitable.

It would take just one year to shatter that illusion. And when politicians tried to restore what war had broken, the human cost would make the 1820s deflation look merciful by comparison. The catastrophe would begin with a decision made in a moment of triumph, by a man who thought himself a hero.

⁴⁰ The pattern of intellectual debate losing to legislative power repeats throughout monetary history. Similar dynamics appear in the 1913 Federal Reserve Act debates, the 1930s-40s functional finance abandonment, and modern central bank independence legislation.

⁴¹ Legislative embedding of automatic rules removes monetary policy from democratic contestation. The Bank Charter Act's gold mechanism operated without parliamentary approval for each contraction, just as modern central bank independence insulates policy from electoral pressure.

⁴² The Act's suspension during crises (1847, 1857, 1866) demonstrated its impracticality, yet it was reinstated each time. This reveals orthodoxy's persistence despite empirical failure—a pattern modern monetary debates continue.

⁴³ Martin Daunton, *Trusting Leviathan: The Politics of Taxation in Britain, 1799-1914* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), documents how fiscal orthodoxy aligned with creditor class interests.

⁴⁴ European Central Bank statute (Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 123) prohibits monetary financing, embedding creditor interests into law exactly as the Bank Charter Act did. Modern "central bank independence" legislation serves similar functions.

⁴⁵ The manufactured orthodoxy pattern operates across centuries: specific class interests develop theoretical frameworks claiming universal benefit, embed them in institutions and law, and present distributional choices as technical necessities. Recognition of this pattern is the first step toward democratic monetary policy.
