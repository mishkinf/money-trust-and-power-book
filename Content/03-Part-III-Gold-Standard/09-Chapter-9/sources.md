# Chapter 9 Sources & Summary

## **Chapter Summary**

The paradox of intellectual defeat and legislative victory: James Wilson's *The Economist* (founded 1843) opposed the Bank Charter Act, joining Banking School theorists Thomas Tooke and John Fullarton in sophisticated critiques. Yet on July 19, 1844, the Act received Royal Assent with overwhelming parliamentary support. The Banking School lost despite controlling influential publications because the Currency School captured the institution that mattered: Parliament. Prime Minister Robert Peel framed the 1844 Act as completing his 1819 Resumption Act, establishing a twenty-five-year arc of Currency School influence. The Act's two-department system made gold constraints automatic, removing monetary policy from democratic contestation. Understanding how this erasure happened—through parliamentary legislation, institutional embedding, and control of knowledge production—reveals that monetary orthodoxy is ideological construction, not natural economic law. The pattern repeats across centuries whenever specific class interests develop theoretical frameworks claiming universal benefit, embed them in institutions and law, and present distributional choices as technical necessities.

²⁷ **Evidentiary Gaps - Examination Papers:**
- Despite extensive research, no political economy examination papers from Oxford or Cambridge for 1820s-1850s could be located in publicly accessible archives. This represents significant evidentiary gap.

³¹ **Mill's Engagement with Both Schools:**
- Mill (1848), engaged both Currency and Banking School arguments while accepting gold standard premises.

³² **Curriculum Control vs. Institutional Presence:**
- The distinction between documented Currency School presence at universities and orchestrated curriculum capture remains crucial—former can be proven, latter requires evidence that remains unavailable.

³⁶ **Bank Charter Act Mechanisms Creating 1925 Deflation:**
- Churchill's 1925 return to gold at pre-war parity ($4.86/£) triggered automatic deflation under Bank Charter Act mechanisms embedded in 1844, demonstrating Currency School legislation's eight-decade policy constraints.

³⁷ **Durham University Special Collections:**
- Harold Heslop Papers (GB-0033-HES).

³⁸ **Banking School Intellectual Sophistication:**

⁴⁰ **Pattern of Intellectual Debate Losing to Legislative Power:**
- Similar dynamics in 1913 Federal Reserve Act debates, 1930s-40s functional finance abandonment, modern central bank independence legislation.

⁴¹ **Legislative Embedding Removing Democratic Contestation:**
- Bank Charter Act's gold mechanism operated without parliamentary approval for each contraction, parallel to modern central bank independence insulating policy from electoral pressure.

⁴² **Act's Suspension Despite Failure:**
- 1847, 1857, 1866 suspensions demonstrated impracticality, yet reinstated each time. Orthodoxy's persistence despite empirical failure.

⁴⁵ **Manufactured Orthodoxy Pattern Across Centuries:**
- Recognition that specific class interests develop theoretical frameworks claiming universal benefit, embed them in institutions and law, and present distributional choices as technical necessities.

### Additional Parliamentary Sources

**Vote Counts and Dynamics:**
²² - Goulburn, Henry. *Parliamentary Debates, Commons*, 3rd ser., vol. 75 (13 June 1844), col. 809. [Broad support noted]

²³ - Despite extensive searching, no recorded division lists for key votes could be located—comporting with mid-19th-century practice where many bills passed without formal divisions.

### Institutional Architecture

**How Orthodoxy Gets Embedded:**
- Automatic rules remove policy from democratic deliberation
- Prestigious professorships control knowledge production
- Journals publish supporting views, ridicule dissent
- Next generation trained to believe alternatives are incoherent
- Each crisis explained as insufficient adherence, not evidence against orthodoxy

**Modern Parallels:**
- Central bank "independence" legislation
- European Monetary Union's no-bailout clauses
- IMF structural adjustment programs
- "Sound money" rhetoric in contemporary fiscal debates
