# PART III: THE GOLD STANDARD ERA AND ITS CONTRADICTIONS

## Chapter 8: The Great Forgetting—How Creditor Interests Manufactured Orthodoxy

**Chapter Premise:** Between 1800-1850, earlier understandings of money creation were systematically erased and replaced by gold orthodoxy that aligned with bondholders' material interests. Thomas Attwood and the Birmingham School understood that money was a social institution that could maintain full employment, but they were marginalized as "currency cranks." What had been explicit in 1694—that banks create money "out of nothing"—became unthinkable in respectable economics. This wasn't the discovery of truth; it was the consolidation of theories that systematically protected creditor wealth through deflation.

### Why Do People Still Believe Household Budget Metaphors?

"We're broke." "The national debt is out of control." "We can't afford Medicare for All." The rhetoric dominates American political discourse. Politicians from both parties invoke household budget metaphors: governments must "tighten their belts," "live within their means," "balance the budget like a family." The metaphor seems intuitive—if households can't spend more than they earn, why should governments?

But the metaphor is false. Households must acquire currency before spending it. Governments that issue their own currency create it by spending. A household that prints its own money goes to jail for counterfeiting. A government that issues its own currency is performing its basic function. The constraints are entirely different.

Yet the household budget metaphor persists with remarkable tenacity, shaping debates about deficits, debt, and government spending despite being economically incoherent. Why? Because the orthodoxy that emerged in the 1810s-1840s aligned systematically with the material interests of those who held government bonds, then became systematically embedded through institutional power. What had been explicit in 1694—that the Bank of England created money "out of nothing"—became unthinkable in respectable economics within 150 years.

This wasn't the discovery of truth. It was the consolidation of economic theories that served specific interests. Understanding how this happened—who benefited materially, what was erased, and why dissent was marginalized—reveals that our current monetary constraints are political choices masquerading as economic laws. The household budget metaphor isn't common sense. It's an economic framework that systematically protected bondholders' interests and has outlived the gold standard that supposedly justified it.

**This chapter traces how the understanding of money as a social institution was systematically erased between 1800-1850 and replaced by gold orthodoxy that aligned with bondholders' material interests.** We'll examine Thomas Attwood and the Birmingham School—who correctly identified monetary contraction as causing distress but were dismissed as "currency cranks"—and analyze how the Bank Charter Act of 1844 attempted to end fractional reserve banking but failed because economists didn't understand deposit creation. The chapter explores Scottish "free banking" (showing it operated within state frameworks, not independently), documents colonial hut taxes as empirical proof that taxation drives currency adoption, and reveals how economic orthodoxy that systematically protected bond values through deflation still dominates policy debates today.

### The Man They Erased

**Few noticed at the time how completely a truth had been buried.** On May 7, 1832, Thomas Attwood stood before the House of Commons making an argument that would get him dismissed as a crank. Britain's economic distress, he insisted, stemmed not from moral failing or foreign competition but from **monetary contraction**. He had watched it happen in Birmingham.

Attwood was no wild-eyed radical. Born in 1783 to a prosperous banking family, he had built a successful business manufacturing buttons and other metal goods in Birmingham—then England's industrial heart, second only to London in population and economic importance. His workers were skilled craftsmen, his business well-established, his social position secure. He was precisely the sort of respectable manufacturer whose opinion should have carried weight in Parliament.²⁷ᵃ

Yet he had seen something that respectable economists, safely ensconced in London offices and university common rooms, refused to acknowledge. During the deflation that followed the 1821 return to gold, **Attwood watched his workers starve**—men who'd worked for him for years, whose skills were undiminished, whose dedication never wavered. The problem wasn't their work ethic or capabilities. The problem was that Attwood couldn't pay them what their labor deserved because his customers couldn't afford to pay him. Money had become scarce throughout Birmingham's industrial economy, and with it, the means to coordinate productive activity. Not because they were lazy or unskilled. Not because demand for Birmingham's products had vanished. But because **money had become scarce**. Prices fell, debts became unpayable, businesses failed, workers lost jobs. The productive capacity remained—the factories, the skills, the demand for goods—but the medium of exchange had contracted, and with it the entire economy.²⁷ᵇ

Attwood understood what David Ricardo and the Currency School did not: **money was not neutral**. Its quantity mattered for employment. When money contracted, real people suffered real deprivation—not because resources had disappeared but because the accounting system that coordinated economic activity had broken down. This was not a natural disaster like drought or plague. It was a **policy choice**, and it could be reversed through policy.²⁷ᶜ

#### The Birmingham Rallies

Attwood didn't merely theorize—he organized. In 1829, he founded the Birmingham Political Union, which became one of the most powerful political organizations in industrial England. The rallies he convened demonstrated that working people and manufacturers could unite around monetary reform, creating a political force that terrified the establishment.

The scale of these gatherings was unprecedented for Birmingham. Contemporary accounts describe crowds of 40,000 workers and craftsmen—blacksmiths, button makers, metal workers, the skilled artisans who made Birmingham England's industrial powerhouse. These weren't desperate mobs but organized demonstrations of political power. The Birmingham Political Union could mobilize tens of thousands on short notice, demonstrating that monetary distress had created a constituency for radical reform.²⁷ᵈ

Attwood's message was clear and systematic:

- The 1821 return to gold had deliberately contracted the money supply, causing deflation
- This deflation destroyed workers' livelihoods not through any fault of their own but through policy choice
- Paper money could maintain full employment without gold backing, as the Bank Restriction period (1797-1821) had demonstrated
- Government should expand money supply to match productive capacity, not constrain it to satisfy creditor demands
- The suffering was **unnecessary**—a choice by policymakers who prioritized bondholders over productive workers²⁷ᵉ

The Birmingham Political Union's influence extended beyond monetary theory. By 1832, it had become a political force that Parliament could not ignore. The Reform Act of 1832—extending voting rights—passed partly due to pressure from Attwood's movement, which demonstrated that excluding working people from politics threatened civil order. Yet Attwood's monetary proposals, the core of his campaign, went nowhere.²⁷ᶠ

#### The Chartist Petition

By 1839, depression had deepened. Attwood helped draft the Chartist petition—a document demanding not just political reform but monetary expansion to relieve economic distress. The petition gathered **1,280,958 signatures**, an extraordinary mobilization representing perhaps 10% of Britain's adult population.

When presented to Parliament, the petition was rejected **235 votes to 46**—a crushing defeat that demonstrated how thoroughly the political establishment had embraced Currency School orthodoxy. The parliamentary debates reveal how completely chartalist understanding had been erased. Opponents didn't engage Attwood's economic arguments—they dismissed him as deluded. There was no serious discussion of whether monetary contraction had caused unemployment, whether paper money could function without gold backing, or whether taxation created currency demand. These ideas, explicit just decades earlier, had become unthinkable in respectable discourse.²⁷ᵍ

#### The Dismissal: When Truth Becomes "Monomania"

The establishment's response was not to engage Attwood's arguments but to pathologize him. Benjamin Disraeli, the future Prime Minister, described him as "a provincial banker labouring under **financial monomania**"—an obsession with money that supposedly blinded him to economic reality. His followers were dismissed as "**currency cranks**" and "**crude inflationists**." The Birmingham School economists were excluded from serious academic discourse, their work treated as curiosities rather than legitimate economic theory.²⁷ʰ

Imagine the experience: You've built a successful business. You've watched skilled workers lose their livelihoods through no fault of their own. You've identified the precise mechanism causing this suffering—monetary contraction. You've articulated solutions that would work. You've mobilized over a million signatures demonstrating mass support. And Parliament's response is to declare you mentally unsound. **"Monomania."** Not wrong, not mistaken—*obsessed*. Psychologically damaged. Unfit for serious consideration.

This wasn't mere academic disagreement—it was character assassination masquerading as diagnosis. Economic journals ignored Birmingham School publications. Universities didn't teach their theories. When establishment economists mentioned Attwood at all, it was to ridicule him as an example of what happens when businessmen dabble in economic theory beyond their competence. His proto-Keynesian insights about the multiplier effect, his understanding that unemployment represented wasted capacity rather than natural equilibrium, his recognition that paper money could function without gold backing—all were buried under dismissive labels that questioned his sanity rather than his arguments.²⁷ⁱ

The personal cost was real. Attwood had sacrificed time, energy, and social capital organizing the Birmingham Political Union and the Chartist movement. He'd made powerful enemies among the bondholding class. He'd been ridiculed in Parliament and dismissed in print. And for what? To watch Parliament reject 1,280,958 signatures with barely a second thought. To see his economic insights erased from the historical record. To be remembered—if at all—as a crank who didn't understand real economics.

By the time Attwood died in 1856, the forgetting was complete. Economic textbooks didn't mention him. The "Birmingham School" had become a footnote to serious economic thought, if it appeared at all. The ideas he had articulated—that money quantity matters for employment, that monetary contraction causes real suffering, that government could maintain full employment through monetary management—had become not merely wrong but unthinkable in respectable economics.²⁷ʲ

**The clues to how this happened were there all along, buried in parliamentary testimony, bondholders' balance sheets, and the systematic transformation of university curricula.** Understanding the mechanism of erasure reveals that monetary orthodoxy is manufactured, not discovered.

#### Modern Vindication—Too Late

A century later, economic historians would recognize that "**the theories of the Birmingham School are now recognized as embryonic versions of the Keynesian economics of the 1930s.**" Attwood had articulated the multiplier effect before it had a name. He understood that unemployment represented wasted capacity, not natural equilibrium. He grasped that paper money could function without gold backing if institutions were credible and taxation created currency demand.²⁷ᵏ

He was **right**. The deflation he warned against did cause unnecessary suffering. The monetary expansion he advocated would have prevented mass unemployment. The flexible paper currency he proposed would have allowed Britain to maintain full employment while managing inflation through policy rather than gold constraints. Every warning he made about the gold standard's deflationary bias would be vindicated by the disasters of 1873-1896 and 1925-1931.

But being right was insufficient. Those who held government bonds—whose real returns increased with deflation—had concentrated political influence. The economic orthodoxy that emerged aligned systematically with their material interests, framing creditor-protecting deflation as sound monetary policy while dismissing employment-supporting monetary expansion as dangerous quackery. Attwood's marginalization followed a pattern that would repeat whenever economic theories threatened powerful interests: dismiss the dissenter as mentally unsound, exclude him from serious discourse, and erase his ideas from the historical record.²⁷ˡ

### How the Forgetting Happened: Distributional Consequences and Institutional Power

The return to gold in 1821 was not merely a technical monetary decision—it was the culmination of a campaign to transform public understanding of government finance. Between 1800 and 1850, earlier conceptions of money creation as a governance tool were systematically replaced by the doctrine that taxes must fund government spending. This transformation aligned with the material interests of those who held government debt: deflation increased the real value of their bond holdings.²⁷ᵃ

The distributional consequences were stark. After the Napoleonic Wars, Britain's National Debt had grown from £12 million in 1700 to **£850 million** by 1815—a seventy-fold increase. Bondholders, merchants, industrialists, and bankers dominated 19th-century commercial society and Parliament. Historian Martin Daunton notes: "After the victory at Waterloo in 1815, consent was lost as a result of the high level of debt service which fell on producers within an unreformed political system." Those holding these bonds faced a material choice: inflation from paper money would erode the real value of their holdings, while deflation—which the return to gold at the old parity guaranteed—would increase the real value of what they were owed.²⁷ᵇ

Bondholders' institutional position reinforced their preference for monetary constraint. They depended on maintaining credit's sanctity, fearing that loss of income might trigger cascading defaults. The fiscal orthodoxy that emerged—framed as protecting taxpayers from government profligacy—had the documented effect of protecting bond values through deflation. As one contemporary assessment stated: "Parliamentary control of finances works only if the government is not in a position to provide for unauthorized expenditures by increasing the circulating amount of fiat money."²⁷ᶜ

Ricardo and the **Currency School**—economists who believed money supply should be rigidly tied to gold reserves—provided intellectual framework for this preference. Ricardo's **Quantity Theory of Money**—the idea that prices rise proportionally with money supply—established that excess money issue causes inflation. **Say's Law**—the claim that supply creates its own demand, making general economic gluts impossible—eliminated theoretical justification for expansionary money creation during depressions. Ricardo's zero-sum growth theory suggested government money creation merely redistributed rather than created value. Whether intended or not, these theories systematically supported policies that protected bond values through monetary constraint.²⁷ᵈ

The **Bank Charter Act of 1844** institutionalized this new orthodoxy into law. It established 100% gold backing requirements for new Bank of England note issues and gave the Bank monopoly on note issuance. This made gold constraint automatic, removing discretion from government. Money creation must be constrained by gold reserves, not government needs. The principle that had been explicit in 1694—that the Bank created money "out of nothing"—became unthinkable in respectable economics.²⁷ᵉ

When dissenters emerged, they were systematically marginalized. **Thomas Attwood and the Birmingham School**—economists who believed money supply should adjust to economic needs rather than being constrained by gold—argued that Britain should have a paper currency not tied to gold and that government should counter depressions by increasing the money supply, proto-Keynesian insights that included formulations of the multiplier effect. Yet Attwood was dismissed as suffering from "financial monomania." Birmingham School economists were called "currency cranks" and "crude inflationists." Despite presenting a petition with 40,000 signatures in 1829, the Duke of Wellington's government refused to consider Attwood's proposal. His 1839 Chartist petition with 1,280,958 signatures was rejected by 235 votes to 46.²⁷ᶠ

Modern assessment recognizes "the theories of the Birmingham School are now recognized as embryonic versions of the Keynesian economics of the 1930s." But in their time, maintaining fiscal orthodoxy prevailed over these alternative frameworks. As Ludwig von Mises later summarized the ideology: "Sound money meant a metallic standard... devised as an instrument for the protection of civil liberties against despotic inroads on the part of governments." The rhetoric emphasized liberty. The documented effect was wealth transfer to bondholders through deflation.²⁷ᵍ

### Distributional consequences: Who gained and who lost

The distributional effects of the gold standard orthodoxy followed a consistent pattern documented across decades. **Creditors gained systematically while debtors, workers, and productive entrepreneurs lost**—wealth redistribution that orthodox economics framed as neutral monetary policy rather than distributional choice.

#### The Mechanics of Wealth Transfer

Consider how deflation systematically redistributed wealth. A creditor who lent £1,000 at 5 percent interest in 1820 expected to receive £1,050 in 1821. Under the gold standard's deflationary pressure (recall Chapter 7's analysis—the 1821 return to gold caused prices to fall approximately 20 percent by 1824), that £1,050 bought **25 percent more goods** in 1824 than the original £1,000 had bought in 1820. The creditor received not just the contracted 5 percent interest but an additional 20 percent real return through deflation.

This wasn't a side effect; it was the core feature. Gold standard advocates explicitly justified the system by claiming it protected creditors' "legitimate expectations" against inflation that would erode bond values.²⁷ᵍ⁻¹

>
> **KEY INSIGHT:** Deflation systematically transfers wealth from debtors/workers to creditors/bondholders. Orthodox economics framed this as "sound money" and "protecting legitimate expectations"—but it was distributional choice presented as technical necessity.

#### The Alternative They Rejected

Compare this to Thomas Attwood and the Birmingham School's proposal: maintain the paper currency established during the Bank Restriction (1797-1821), allow prices to stabilize at their current level, and adjust money supply to economic needs rather than gold constraints.

Under this system:
- Existing debts repaid at contracted rates **without deflationary wealth transfer**
- Workers face **neither wage cuts nor unemployment spikes**
- Government debt burden remains at nominal level **rather than increasing in real terms**
- Creditors receive exactly what they contracted for (5% interest) **but not the additional 15-20% windfall from deflation**

The orthodoxy's rhetoric obscured these distributional effects. Ricardo's Quantity Theory framed inflation as universally harmful, ignoring that mild inflation transfers wealth from creditors to debtors and productive entrepreneurs while deflation does the reverse. Say's Law claimed general gluts were impossible, denying that monetary contraction could cause systemic unemployment. The Currency School's focus on "automatic" gold adjustment portrayed the wealth transfer as natural market correction rather than policy choice.

When workers resisted wage cuts or debtors defaulted on loans whose real burden had doubled, orthodox economics blamed their moral failings—laziness, improvidence, speculation—rather than recognizing that monetary policy had systematically disadvantaged them.²⁷ᵍ⁻⁶

The Bank Charter Act of 1844 institutionalized this distribution into law, making creditor interests automatic through gold constraints while presenting this as neutral monetary management. The marginalizing of Attwood and the Birmingham School wasn't about technical economics—their analysis proved more accurate than Ricardo's in predicting depression and unemployment. It was about power: maintaining a system that transferred wealth upward while claiming this transfer was natural economic law.²⁷ᵍ⁻⁷

**Why This History Matters Now:**

The distributional analysis we just examined isn't ancient history—it's the template for understanding modern fiscal debates. When politicians today claim "we must cut Social Security because we can't afford it" or "tax cuts will pay for themselves," they're deploying rhetoric refined in the 1820s-1840s to protect bond values through deflation. The pattern is identical: present distributional choices (whose income gets cut, whose wealth gets protected) as technical necessities, frame fiscal "discipline" as neutral policy rather than class interest, and dismiss alternatives as irresponsible radicalism.

The question to ask when hearing "we can't afford it": Who benefits from this constraint? Bondholders gained £160 million in real wealth through 1821-1824 deflation—the modern equivalent would be trillions transferred from wage earners to wealth-holders through monetary policy presented as technical necessity. Understanding how the 19th-century orthodoxy was manufactured helps us recognize when similar rhetoric serves similar interests today.

---

The Birmingham School's defeat seemed total. Attwood's petition was rejected, his economic theories dismissed as "monomania," his proto-Keynesian insights erased from respectable economics. But the victory wasn't won through superior evidence or theoretical rigor. It was manufactured through institutional power—Parliament, prestigious professorships, and the force of law. Understanding how this manufacturing happened reveals that monetary orthodoxy is ideological construction, not natural economic law. The next chapter examines the mechanisms of this erasure. It was manufactured through institutional power that embedded Currency School doctrine into the architecture of British economic thought. Understanding **how** this erasure happened reveals that monetary orthodoxy is ideological construction, not natural economic law.²⁷ʰ
