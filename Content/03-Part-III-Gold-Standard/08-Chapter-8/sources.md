# Chapter 8 Sources & Summary

## **Chapter Summary**

Between 1800-1850, earlier understandings of money creation were systematically erased and replaced by gold orthodoxy that aligned with bondholders' material interests. Thomas Attwood and the Birmingham School understood that money was a social institution that could maintain full employment, but they were marginalized as "currency cranks." What had been explicit in 1694—that banks create money "out of nothing"—became unthinkable in respectable economics. This wasn't the discovery of truth; it was the consolidation of theories that systematically protected creditor wealth through deflation. The lesson extends beyond the 19th century: the pattern repeats whenever economic theories align with powerful interests, and orthodoxy claiming scientific neutrality while systematically benefiting one group deserves skeptical examination.
