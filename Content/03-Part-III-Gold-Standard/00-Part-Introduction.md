# PART III: THE GOLD STANDARD ERA AND ITS CONTRADICTIONS

## The Accidental Orthodoxy and the Great Forgetting

The gold standard emerged not from careful design but from Isaac Newton's mathematics, Brazilian geology, and institutional accident. What began as a modest adjustment to England's bimetallic system in 1717 became, by 1880, the dominant monetary architecture of the industrialized world. For a century, gold seemed to provide the stability that paper money alone could not. But this apparent success concealed profound contradictions—and buried truths that earlier generations had understood clearly.

The gold standard worked not because of gold but because of the institutions managing it. The Bank of England's credibility, Parliament's taxing power, and Britain's fiscal capacity made gold convertibility believable. When those institutions faltered, as they would in the 1920s and 1930s, gold could not save the system. Yet the gold standard's century of success created a false narrative: people came to believe that gold caused monetary stability rather than recognizing it as a consequence of institutional credibility.

More dangerously, the gold standard's success systematically erased earlier understandings of how money actually works. What had been explicit in 1694—that the Bank of England created money "out of nothing"—became unthinkable in respectable economics by 1850. Thinkers who understood that money was a social institution, that taxation drove currency demand, that unemployment represented wasted capacity not natural equilibrium—these voices were marginalized, dismissed, and forgotten. The "great forgetting" was not accidental. It served specific class interests, and it would cost millions of lives when the system finally collapsed. **The creditor class promoted "sound money" as neutral economic truth when it was actually class ideology designed to protect their real returns.**

This Part traces the gold standard's rise, operation, and intellectual transformation:

**Chapter 6** examines Newton's accidental creation of the gold standard and its globalization by 1880—appearing self-regulating but actually requiring Bank of England management while redistributing wealth from debtor to creditor.

**Chapter 7** reveals what the gold standard's success made people forget—the 1797-1821 Bank Restriction proving paper money could work without gold, yet the 1821 return causing devastating deflation ignored as evidence.

**Chapter 8** introduces the dissenters who understood what orthodoxy buried—Thomas Attwood gathering 1.3 million signatures for monetary reform, dismissed as suffering "financial monomania," his proto-Keynesian insights systematically marginalized.

**Chapter 9** examines how orthodoxy was manufactured through institutional power—Peel's 1844 Bank Charter Act embedding Currency School principles into law, banks shifting from notes to deposits, and the truth about money creation becoming unthinkable in respectable economics.

By the end of Part III, the gold standard appears triumphant—the foundation of international commerce, the guarantor of monetary stability, the natural order of finance. But the contradictions are accumulating. The system imposes deflation when economies need expansion, redistributes wealth upward while claiming neutrality, and requires institutional management while pretending to be automatic. And most dangerously, it has buried the truth about money so deeply that even brilliant economists have forgotten what their predecessors once knew. The breaking, when it comes, will reveal what the gold standard's success had obscured: money is a human institution, and institutions endure only when they serve the societies that create them.
