# PART III: THE GOLD STANDARD ERA AND ITS CONTRADICTIONS

## The Accidental Orthodoxy and the Great Forgetting

The gold standard emerged not from careful design but from Isaac Newton's mathematics, Brazilian geology, and institutional accident. What began as a modest adjustment to England's bimetallic system in 1717 became, by 1880, the dominant monetary architecture of the industrialized world. For a century, gold seemed to provide the stability that paper money alone could not. But this apparent success concealed profound contradictions—and buried truths that earlier generations had understood clearly.

The gold standard worked not because of gold but because of the institutions managing it. The Bank of England's credibility, Parliament's taxing power, and Britain's fiscal capacity made gold convertibility believable. When those institutions faltered, as they would in the 1920s and 1930s, gold could not save the system. Yet the gold standard's century of success created a false narrative: people came to believe that gold caused monetary stability rather than recognizing it as a consequence of institutional credibility.

More dangerously, the gold standard's success systematically erased earlier understandings of how money actually works. What had been explicit in 1694—that the Bank of England created money "out of nothing"—became unthinkable in respectable economics by 1850. Thinkers who understood that money was a social institution, that taxation drove currency demand, that unemployment represented wasted capacity not natural equilibrium—these voices were marginalized, dismissed, and forgotten. The "great forgetting" was not accidental. It served specific class interests, and it would cost millions of lives when the system finally collapsed. **The creditor class promoted "sound money" as neutral economic truth when it was actually class ideology designed to protect their real returns.**

This Part traces the gold standard's rise, operation, and intellectual transformation across three chapters:

**Chapter 6** examines Newton's accidental creation of the gold standard and its globalization by 1880. The system appeared self-regulating—exchange rates fixed by gold content, automatic adjustment through gold flows—but the reality was far more complex. The Bank of England managed gold reserves through interest rate manipulation, not passive acceptance of market forces. The system redistributed wealth from debtor to creditor, periphery to core, imposing deflationary bias that served creditor interests while claiming to serve universal principles. Yet the gold standard's success planted the seeds of a dangerous forgetting. What Paterson, Smith, and Hume had understood clearly about money creation would soon become unthinkable.

**Chapter 7** reveals what the gold standard's success made people forget. The Bank Restriction Act of 1797-1821 had proven that paper money could function without gold backing if institutions were credible. Bank of England notes circulated successfully for 24 years with no gold convertibility. Yet the return to gold in 1821 caused devastating deflation—note circulation contracted 92%, wheat prices fell 58%, farmers faced insolvency. The human cost was staggering, but the lesson was ignored. Paper money had worked. Gold was not necessary. But this truth would be systematically buried.

**Chapter 8** reveals how the great forgetting happened—and whose interests it served. Thomas Attwood, a Birmingham manufacturer, watched his workers starve during the 1821 deflation and understood that monetary contraction, not moral failing, caused the suffering. He argued that money was a social institution that could maintain full employment. He gathered over a million signatures demanding reform. Parliament dismissed him as a crank. The Currency School defeated the Banking School, the Birmingham School was marginalized, and what had been explicit in 1694—that the Bank created money "out of nothing"—became unthinkable in respectable economics. The creditor class promoted "sound money" doctrine that served their material interests while claiming to serve universal principles. The Bank Charter Act of 1844 tried to end fractional reserve banking by controlling note issuance, but banks simply shifted to creating deposits instead—an unintended consequence that would shape banking for the next century.

By the end of Part III, the gold standard appears triumphant—the foundation of international commerce, the guarantor of monetary stability, the natural order of finance. But the contradictions are accumulating. The system imposes deflation when economies need expansion, redistributes wealth upward while claiming neutrality, and requires institutional management while pretending to be automatic. And most dangerously, it has buried the truth about money so deeply that even brilliant economists have forgotten what their predecessors once knew. The breaking, when it comes, will reveal what the gold standard's success had obscured: money is a human institution, and institutions endure only when they serve the societies that create them.
