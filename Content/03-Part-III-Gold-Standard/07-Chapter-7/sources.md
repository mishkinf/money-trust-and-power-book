# Chapter 07 Sources & Summary

### **Chapter Summary**

The Bank Restriction Act of 1797-1821 was the first successful experiment in fiat currency by a major power. When French invasion panic triggered a run on the Bank of England, the Privy Council suspended gold convertibility—a suspension announced as temporary that lasted 24 years. Bank notes continued to circulate successfully because of institutional credibility: the Bank's century-long track record, merchant support, credible commitment to eventual resumption, fiscal backing through Pitt's income tax, and ultimate war victory. The Bullionist Controversy erupted in 1809, with Ricardo arguing for immediate gold resumption while establishing the paradigm that taxes must fund spending—a radical departure from the 1694 understanding that banks create money "out of nothing." Henry Thornton's 1802 work anticipated modern monetary economics, warning that rapid monetary contraction causes real economic pain through sticky wages. The Real Bills Doctrine—the fallacy that lending against commercial paper prevents inflation—would survive 150 years and contribute to the Great Depression. When gold convertibility was restored in 1821, note circulation contracted 92% over seven years, causing devastating deflation. Wheat prices fell 60%, farmers faced doubled real debt burdens, and thousands went insolvent. The human cost was staggering, but the gold standard had been restored—at a price economists measuring indices could not capture.
