# PART II: THE INSTITUTIONAL REVOLUTION

## Chapter 4: When Private Money Failed

**Chapter Premise:** Goldsmith banking emerged accidentally after Charles I's 1640 seizure of deposits, creating England's first private paper money through fractional reserve lending. The Stop of the Exchequer in 1672 destroyed this system, proving that private money creation—however ingenious—could not provide systemic stability.

### When the Shadow Banks Froze

On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. Within hours, the global financial system seized. Money market funds—supposedly safe investments that millions of Americans used like checking accounts—"broke the buck," losing value below their $1 net asset value. Repo markets, where banks borrowed overnight using securities as collateral, froze entirely. Asset-backed commercial paper, the short-term debt that funded everything from car loans to credit cards, became unsellable. The shadow banking system—a vast network of private money creation operating outside traditional banking regulation—collapsed overnight.

The Federal Reserve responded with unprecedented intervention: emergency lending facilities, trillions in liquidity support, guarantees for money market funds. Critics called it a bailout. Defenders called it necessary. But few recognized what the crisis actually revealed: private money creation, however sophisticated, cannot provide systemic stability without a public backstop.

This wasn't a new lesson. It was a lesson England learned in 1672, when Charles II's Stop of the Exchequer destroyed the goldsmith banking system. The goldsmiths had created England's first private paper money through fractional reserve lending—exactly the mechanism shadow banks used in 2008. Their system worked brilliantly until confidence collapsed. Then, without a lender of last resort, the entire structure imploded. The 2008 crisis was the goldsmith catastrophe replayed with modern instruments. Understanding why requires understanding how private money creation emerged—and why it always fails without sovereign backing.

**This chapter traces how goldsmith banking emerged accidentally after Charles I seized deposits at the Royal Mint in 1640, forcing merchants to store gold with private goldsmiths who discovered they could lend multiples of their deposits.** We'll examine how fractional reserve banking—where banks hold only a fraction of deposits as reserves while lending the rest—developed organically, how the Great Fire of 1666 tested but didn't break the system, and how Charles II's Stop of the Exchequer in 1672 proved catastrophic. The chapter draws explicit parallels to modern shadow banking collapses (2008, Terra/Luna, FTX), demonstrating that private money creation, however ingenious, cannot provide stability without public institutional backing.

A cold rain fell on London as William of Orange rode through the city gates in December 1688. He had crossed the Channel with an army, but he would take the throne without a battle. King James II, abandoned by his own officers and nobles, had fled to France. What followed was not merely a change of monarchs but a **constitutional revolution**—a fundamental restructuring of government that permanently transferred power from crown to Parliament, reshaping not just England's government but its entire financial system.¹

The settlement was explicit: William and Mary would rule, but only if they accepted Parliament's supremacy. The Bill of Rights (1689) declared that the monarch could not suspend laws, levy taxes, or maintain a standing army without parliamentary consent. For the first time in English history, the power to spend and the power to tax were **legally inseparable**. A king could no longer borrow on his personal credit and leave Parliament to clean up the mess. Every loan, every expenditure, every military campaign would require legislative approval.²

This was not a theoretical nicety. It was a **financial revolution** disguised as a political one. By tying the crown's hands, Parliament made England's debt credible. Lenders no longer had to trust a king's word; they could trust a nation's law.

### The goldsmith catastrophe: Why private money failed

To understand what the Bank of England would become, one must first grasp what existed before it—and why it failed catastrophically. The story begins not with the Glorious Revolution but with a desperate wartime improvisation that would accidentally create England's first private paper money, only to see it collapse in spectacular ruin.

In 1640, **Charles I seized £200,000 from the Royal Mint** to finance his escalating conflicts with Parliament and Scotland. The King's agents simply walked into the Mint, took the money, and left merchants and nobles with worthless receipts. The act destroyed confidence in government storage overnight. Wealthy Londoners who had trusted the crown with their bullion now faced a choice: where could they safely store their wealth?³

The answer came from an unlikely source: the goldsmiths of Lombard Street. This narrow medieval thoroughfare—just 260 meters from Bank junction to Gracechurch Street—had become London's financial heart. The street was lined with "good and lofty buildings" whose ground floors housed goldsmith shops, each marked by hanging signs that served as landmarks in an era of limited literacy: The Unicorn for Edward Backwell's establishment, The Grasshopper for the Gresham family, The Vine for Thomas and Robert Vyner.⁴

Inside these establishments, large arched windows opened onto the street, fitted with horizontal shutters that lowered at night for security. The lower shutter folded down to form a counter where customers stood outside while the goldsmith served from within. Samuel Pepys recorded visiting Backwell's shop on June 17, 1662, finding "his lady going to take coach stood in the shop" where a Portuguese merchant offered her "a gilded glassfull of perfumed comfits." These were not merely banking offices but social spaces where business and display intertwined—gilt vessels, imported delicacies, the banker's wife greeting clients.⁵

Behind the ground-floor shop, the buildings extended deep with living quarters above and, crucially, secure vaults below or in back rooms. These vaults—originally built to secure goldsmith inventory—became the foundation of England's first banking system. After 1640, goldsmiths began accepting deposits of gold and silver from wealthy Londoners who no longer trusted the crown. They issued receipts as proof of storage, initially simple warehouse documents: "Received from John Smith ten pounds sterling in gold coin, to be returned upon presentation of this receipt."⁶

By 1669, the scale of goldsmith banking had grown dramatically. Backwell showed Pepys "the model of his houses that he is going to build in Cornhill and Lumbard Street; but he hath purchased so much there, that it looks like a little town." By December 1670, Backwell had expanded his own house from 13 to 21 hearths—a substantial enlargement reflecting banking operations that now served hundreds of London's elite. Inside, scribal clerks maintained leather-bound ledgers in quill pen, recording deposits and withdrawals in double-entry bookkeeping. Backwell's 1671-72 customer ledger would eventually contain 666 folios detailing 400 customers' accounts, including the king himself, Prince Rupert, the East India Company, and hundreds of merchants, doctors, lawyers, and military officers.⁷

But during the English Civil War (1642-1651), a revolutionary change occurred. Goldsmiths began issuing receipts **"payable to bearer"** rather than to a named individual. This subtle shift transformed the receipts from personal IOUs into something that could circulate throughout London. A merchant receiving a goldsmith receipt in payment didn't need to visit the goldsmith to redeem it—he could simply pass it to the next person. London had accidentally invented **the first true private paper money in English history**.⁵

By the 1660s, goldsmith banking had become the dominant force in London finance. Edward Backwell, originally a goldsmith on Fleet Street, had transformed his business into something resembling a modern bank. His depositors included Charles II himself, the future James II, Samuel Pepys, and the East India Company. Other major goldsmith-bankers—Robert Vyner, Alderman John Coggs, Gilbert Whitehall—competed for the business of England's elite.⁶

But this dominance would face a devastating test. On September 2, 1666, fire broke out in Thomas Farriner's bakery on Pudding Lane. Within hours, driven by strong winds, it had become an inferno consuming the City of London. By 10:00 a.m. on Monday, September 3, the flames reached "the wealthiest part of the City, the area around Lombard Street and Gracechurch Street." Pepys witnessed goldsmiths rushing to save their businesses: "Among others I now saw my little goldsmith, Stokes, receiving some friend's goods, whose house itself was burned the day after." Robert Vyner "had just enough time to collect his papers, detailing the vast debt owed to him by the crown, and plate." By 4:00 p.m., "the financial centre of the city (and home to many of England's wealthiest men) succumbed to the fire." Thomas Vincent recorded: "the houses tumble, tumble, tumble with a great crash, leaving the foundations open to the view of the Heavens."⁸

The Great Fire destroyed Lombard Street's physical infrastructure but could not destroy the system that had emerged there. Goldsmiths' ledgers—saved in desperate rushes as flames approached—contained the real value: the records of who owed what to whom. Backwell and others rebuilt. Within five years, Lombard Street rose again, more prosperous than before. Backwell's 1669-1670 expansion came after the Fire, proof that private banking had survived catastrophe. The ledgers, the reputations, the network of trust—these proved more durable than buildings. It was a crucial lesson in what mattered for a banking system: not physical gold in vaults but the institutional memory of obligations. The system that survived the Great Fire would prove unable to survive something more dangerous: a king's default.⁹

### The Discovery: How Bankers Realized Gold Could Multiply

The transformation from warehouse to bank happened through careful observation and bold calculation. A London goldsmith—we don't know which one first made the leap, as no one documented the eureka moment—noticed a pattern in his vault.

**The observation:** Day after day, week after week, the gold sat undisturbed. Depositors left it there. When withdrawals occurred, they averaged only about 1/36th of total deposits on any given day. Some customers withdrew, others deposited, but the net balance barely fluctuated. The vault held £10,000 in gold, yet typical daily withdrawals never exceeded £300.

Then a merchant approached requesting a loan of £500 for a trading voyage to the East Indies. He needed capital to purchase wool for export, couldn't wait months for his own ship to return, and offered to pay 8 percent interest—two points above the legal usury limit of 6 percent, quietly arranged as "exchange" rather than loan.

**The goldsmith's calculation:**

- Gold in vault: £10,000
- Typical daily withdrawals: £300 (3% of deposits)
- Maximum withdrawal in any week: £500 (5% of deposits)
- Probability all depositors withdraw simultaneously: Near zero based on years of observation
- Loan requested: £500
- Interest at 8%: £40 annually
- Current income from storage fees: ~£10 on £10,000

The mathematics were compelling. If he lent £500 from £10,000 in deposits, he would still have £9,500 in the vault—far more than needed to meet typical withdrawal demands. The risk was real but calculable: what if depositors demanded more than usual? But years of experience suggested they wouldn't.

**The innovation:** Instead of giving the borrower physical gold, the goldsmith issued him a bearer receipt for £500—"payable to bearer on demand." The borrower walked out with paper. The goldsmith still had all £10,000 in gold sitting in his vault. But now £10,500 in receipts circulated in London—£10,000 in legitimate deposit receipts plus £500 in the loan receipt.

**Money had been created from nothing.**

The goldsmith had just discovered fractional reserve banking through empirical observation and arithmetic. The ledger showed the mechanism clearly in double-entry form:

**Assets (what goldsmith owns):**
- Gold in vault: £10,000
- Loan to merchant: £500

**Liabilities (what goldsmith owes):**
- Deposits: £10,000
- Bearer receipt issued: £500

The books balanced perfectly. But the goldsmith now had £10,500 in claims against £10,000 in gold. This would work perfectly as long as not everyone demanded their gold simultaneously.

The first goldsmith who tried this probably felt enormous anxiety about the risk. What if word spread? What if all depositors came tomorrow? What if the borrower defaulted and couldn't repay? The receipt circulated through London—from borrower to wool merchant to cloth seller to tavern keeper. Each person who received it assumed it was backed by actual gold in the vault. And in a sense, it was—just not exclusively.

But nothing catastrophic happened. The loan receipt circulated like any other. The borrower repaid after the voyage returned profit. The system worked. Word spread among goldsmiths—cautiously, through observation of competitors rather than public announcement. Within a decade, every major goldsmith on Lombard Street did the same thing: lending multiples of their actual reserves through issuance of bearer receipts.

They had accidentally discovered what modern economics calls **money creation through credit expansion**. The goldsmith didn't lend existing money—he created new money by making the loan. The mechanism: a promise backed by sufficient reserves to meet probable demand, not actual demand.

**How fractional reserves actually worked:** Historical records show typical cash balances fluctuated by only 1/36th of total deposits day-to-day. This meant goldsmiths could safely maintain **reserve ratios** (the percentage of deposits held as reserves rather than lent out) of approximately 10 percent—holding just £1 in gold for every £10 in circulating receipts. The bolder goldsmiths went lower. The more cautious went higher. Richard Cantillon, writing in the 1730s, documented ranges from 10 percent to 66 percent across different goldsmith-bankers.

---

**Was this authorized?** No. Goldsmith banking emerged in a legal gray area—no charters, no parliamentary authorization, purely emergent based on commercial practice. This contrasts sharply with chartered institutions like Sweden's Riksbank (1668) or Amsterdam's Wisselbank (1609), which operated under explicit government mandate. English goldsmith receipts represent perhaps the only clear historical case of large-scale private money creation without initial state sanction.⁹

The 2008 shadow banking system emerged the same way: unregulated, unchartered, purely market-driven. Money market funds, repo markets, and structured investment vehicles created money substitutes without government authorization. Regulators didn't ban them because they didn't recognize them as banks. The pattern repeats across centuries: private innovation creates money, regulators lag behind, crisis reveals the gap.

### Backwell's Impossible Choices

On the morning of **January 2, 1672**, that foundation crumbled. Charles II, desperate for funds to wage the Third Anglo-Dutch War, issued an order suspending repayment of **£1.3 million** owed to the goldsmith-bankers. The **Stop of the Exchequer**, as it became known, was in effect a sovereign default.

Edward Backwell likely learned of the Stop within hours—news traveled fast on Lombard Street. The king's proclamation appeared in the London Gazette on January 4. By then, Backwell already knew the arithmetic of his ruin.

**His situation on January 2, 1672:**

- **Assets:** Crown owes £295,994 (22% of total Stop, virtually his entire capital)
- **Liabilities:** Depositors can demand equivalent amounts—Duke of Albemarle, Sir George Carteret, East India Company, hundreds of merchants
- **Reserves:** Fractional (estimated 10-20% based on typical goldsmith ratios)
- **Normal operation:** Earn spread between 6% paid to depositors and 8-10% earned on Crown debt
- **Current reality:** Largest asset just froze; liabilities remain fully liquid

**His choices:**

**Choice 1: Continue Normal Operations**
- Problem: Crown won't repay the £295,994, eliminating primary asset and cash flow
- Result: Depletes reserves within weeks once depositors learn of Stop
- Timeline to failure: Days to weeks

**Choice 2: Suspend Payments Immediately**
- Problem: Admitting insolvency triggers panic across all Lombard Street
- Impact: Other goldsmith-bankers holding his receipts face losses, cascade begins
- Consequence: Bankruptcy, possible prosecution, personal ruin after 30+ years building reputation

**Choice 3: Call in Private Loans, Refuse New Deposits**
- Problem: Private borrowers can't repay instantly (capital tied up in voyages, inventory)
- Timing: Takes months to collect; depositors won't wait
- Still doesn't solve: Crown debt remains frozen regardless
- Result: Damages merchant relationships while failing to prevent collapse

**Choice 4: Beg Crown for Partial/Emergency Payment**
- Problem: Crown suspended payments precisely because Treasury is empty
- Reality: King promises 6% interest \"someday\" but no principal for \"at least one year\"
- Crown's position: 82 warships being prepared, all funds diverted to war
- Result: Empty promises, no actual money
- **This is what Backwell actually attempted**

**The Game Theory Trap:**

Each player's rational individual choice creates collective catastrophe:
- Crown's rational choice: Suspend payments to creditors rather than lose war
- Backwell's rational choice: Keep operating, hope for Crown repayment rather than admit ruin
- Each depositor's rational choice: Withdraw NOW before vault empties
- Collective result: Bank run, systemic collapse, no Nash equilibrium exists that prevents disaster

The king would pay 6 percent annual interest—someday, eventually, when revenues allowed—but no principal for at least one year. Backwell's assets had just transformed from liquid obligations payable on demand into frozen long-term bonds of uncertain value. His liabilities remained unchanged: depositors could demand their gold at any moment. **The fundamental equation of banking—borrow short, lend long—had become a death spiral.**

Within days, depositors began arriving at The Unicorn. Some demanded immediate withdrawal. Others, understanding the situation, asked anxious questions: Could Backwell honor his receipts? Would the king eventually pay? Should they withdraw now before the vault emptied? Each withdrawal forced Backwell to dip into reserves. Each question spread fear to other depositors. The classic bank run dynamics—rational individually, catastrophic collectively—began playing out on Lombard Street.

By January 5—just three days after the Stop—the Treasury summoned an emergency meeting. The attendee list documented in Treasury minute books reads like a register of England's financial and political elite: the Duke of York, Prince Rupert, the Duke of Monmouth, and "Sir Robt. Viner, Alderman Backwell, Mr. Meynell, Mr. Lyndsy, Mr. Snow, Mr. Portman, and other bankers concerned." They gathered at the Treasury on Sunday, January 7, at four in the afternoon. Backwell sat at that table knowing his life's work was crumbling. He had built a banking empire serving royalty and merchants, accumulated vast wealth, expanded his Lombard Street holdings into "a little town." Now he faced ruin through no fault of his own—his business model was sound, his lending prudent, his reserves adequate under normal circumstances. The king had simply changed the rules.

The bankers sought concessions: quarterly interest payments, legal protection against lawsuits from depositors, formal accounting of debts. The Treasury promised to "ask the King's pleasure" and "consult and prepare what may be done." By January 19, the crown stripped Backwell of his role as receiver of the Queen's Portuguese revenues—eliminating one of his few remaining income streams. There would be no rescue, no emergency loans, no government support. The goldsmith-bankers were on their own.

Five major goldsmith banks failed immediately. Edward Backwell's firm, Sir Robert Vyner's establishment, and three others collapsed within months. Nine additional goldsmith-banking houses were severely undermined. Over **10,000 wealthy families** who had deposited money with the goldsmiths or held their receipts were financially ruined. Bishop Gilbert Burnet recorded that "the bankers were broken, and multitudes who had put their money in their hands were ruined by this dishonourable and perfidious action." Commerce in London "ground to a halt" as credit dried up and cash became scarce.¹⁰

**The cascade was immediate but the suffering was prolonged.** Backwell struggled for a decade to meet depositor demands while the crown made sporadic, insufficient payments. He continued in official service—he had little choice, as the crown was his only hope of eventual recovery. But his banking operations never recovered liquidity. Depositors who had trusted The Unicorn with their wealth found themselves creditors in an endless bankruptcy proceeding. Some accepted partial payments. Others sued. Many waited years for pennies on the pound. In 1682—ten years after the Stop—Backwell was formally declared bankrupt. He died in exile the following year, June 13, 1683, his life's work destroyed by a king's war financing decision.¹¹

Sir Robert Vyner fared no better despite being owed over £400,000—the largest single creditor. Vyner had made Charles II's coronation regalia, served as Lord Mayor of London in 1674-75, and stood at the pinnacle of Restoration society. The Stop ruined him. Courts declared him bankrupt in 1683-84. His will ordered the sale of his entire estate to pay creditors 30 percent of principal—seventy cents on the dollar after twelve years of waiting. He died September 2, 1688, reportedly "broken-hearted at the death of his only son," though the Stop's ruin surely contributed.¹²

**The legal battle consumed a generation.** The crown's promise of "one year" suspension proved worthless. From 1672 to 1675—three years—the government paid nothing. Not interest, not principal. When payments finally began in 1675, they covered only a fraction of obligations. From 1680 to 1685, the crown paid only 56 percent of expected amounts. Under James II (1685-1688), payments collapsed to just 21 percent. After the Glorious Revolution (1688), payments "dried up altogether" as William and Mary reallocated hereditary excise revenues to the Nine Years' War against France.¹³

Creditors turned to the courts. The Court of Exchequer ruled for the bankers in 1692—twenty years after the Stop. The Court of Exchequer Chamber reversed the decision in 1696 "on technical grounds which left a general feeling that an injustice had been done" among creditors. The House of Lords ruled for the bankers in January 1700—but Parliament had already allocated all hereditary excise revenues to current spending, rendering the legal victory meaningless.¹⁴

Parliament imposed the final settlement in 1701 through the Appropriation of Revenue Act. The terms were devastating: interest rates reduced from 6 percent to 3 percent, payments only from December 1705 forward (ignoring all missed interest from 1680 to 1704), and recognition of principal at effectively 50 percent of original value. In 1716, the National Debt Act reduced the rate further to 2.5 percent. A modern scholar calculated the effective investment return over the entire period: **0.01 percent annually**. Creditors who had lent the king money in 1672 expecting 8-10 percent returns received virtually nothing over thirty-four years.¹⁵

The message was unmistakable: private banking without institutional support was financial suicide. When the Bank of England was chartered in 1694—still years before the Stop's creditors would receive final settlement—Parliament designed it explicitly to prevent such catastrophe. The Bank would have a royal charter, parliamentary backing, and the power to issue uniform currency. It would serve as lender of last resort when private credit froze. Most importantly, its debts would be secured by parliamentary taxation, not royal whim. **The goldsmith catastrophe had taught England that private money creation requires public institutional support.**

The Stop proved two things. First, goldsmith receipts had become **true money**—otherwise the default wouldn't have caused such catastrophic systemic disruption. Second, and more importantly, the Stop demonstrated the **fatal flaw of unregulated private money**: no crisis resolution mechanism. When the system failed, there was no **lender of last resort** (an institution that can provide emergency liquidity to banks during crises), no deposit insurance, no government backstop.¹³

The solution, when it finally came in 1694, was **state intervention**. The Bank of England was chartered explicitly to solve the problems the goldsmith catastrophe had revealed: create a stable institutional framework, provide government finance on sound terms, issue uniform currency backed by parliamentary taxation, and offer crisis liquidity when private credit froze.¹⁴

The Stop of the Exchequer proved that private money creation, however ingenious, could not provide systemic stability. What England needed was not more private ingenuity but a public institution—one that could create money with the full backing of the state's fiscal power. That innovation would come in 1694, but not before one final attempt to solve the crisis through war and revolution. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 would provide the constitutional foundation; the Bank of England would provide the institutional mechanism. Together, they would transform not just England's finances but the nature of money itself.

And that transformation illuminates 2008 with brutal clarity. The Federal Reserve's response—emergency lending facilities, trillions in liquidity, guarantees for money market funds—vindicated the lesson England learned in 1694: private money creation requires a public backstop. The Fed became lender of last resort not just to banks but to the entire shadow banking system. Without this intervention, the crisis would have destroyed the financial system as completely as the Stop destroyed goldsmith banking.

Cryptocurrency advocates who dream of purely private money systems should study the goldsmith catastrophe carefully. The pattern repeats with metronomic regularity.

**Terra/Luna (May 2022): Algorithmic Promises Without Backing**

Terra's UST stablecoin promised $1 value through an algorithmic relationship with LUNA token—not backed by actual dollars, just circular promises.

**1672 parallel:** Goldsmith receipts promising gold "on demand" but backed by fractional reserves. The promise worked until tested.

**Mechanism:** UST maintained $1 peg through arbitrage—if UST drops below $1, burn UST to create LUNA. But this only works if people want LUNA. When confidence broke, the peg collapsed.

**The cascade:** May 2022, UST fell to $0.10 within days. LUNA dropped from $80 to near-zero. $40 billion vanished. Exactly like 1672: paper promises became worthless when the backing (LUNA value = Crown payments) disappeared.

**Three Arrows Capital (June 2022): The Counterparty Cascade**

3AC borrowed from multiple crypto lenders using the same collateral (GBTC, stETH).

**1672 parallel:** Goldsmiths maintained clearing accounts with each other. When Backwell failed, other goldsmiths holding his receipts faced losses, triggering their own failures.

**Mechanism:** 3AC owed $3.5 billion to Genesis, BlockFi, Voyager. All assumed collateral was safe. When Luna collapse destroyed collateral value, margin calls came simultaneously. 3AC couldn't pay any of them.

**Result:** 3AC default triggered Genesis's problems, BlockFi's near-failure, Voyager's bankruptcy. Network interconnection amplified individual failure into systemic crisis—identical to Lombard Street 1672.

**Celsius Network (June 2022): The Withdrawal Freeze**

Celsius operated like a bank: paid interest on deposits, lent them out for yield. When Terra/Luna collapsed, their investments lost value. But depositors could still demand withdrawals.

**1672 parallel:** Backwell's exact problem. Assets (Crown debt = Celsius's crypto loans) frozen. Liabilities (depositor claims) still liquid and demand-able.

**Timeline:** June 12, Celsius freezes all withdrawals. Claims it's "to put Celsius in a better position to honor...withdrawal obligations." July 13, files for bankruptcy. 1.7 million users, $20 billion in assets, gone.

**The same impossible choices:** Continue normal operations (deplete reserves), freeze withdrawals (admit insolvency), or hope asset values recover (they didn't). Backwell faced this in 1672. Celsius faced it in 2022. Same problem, same outcome.

**FTX (November 2022): Fractional Reserves Without Ledgers**

FTX, the world's second-largest crypto exchange, used customer deposits to fund risky bets by its sister trading firm, Alameda Research.

**1672 parallel:** Exact goldsmith fractional reserve mechanism—hold deposits, lend them out, hope withdrawals stay manageable.

**The innovation:** Goldsmiths at least maintained meticulous ledgers (Backwell's 666 folios tracking 400 accounts). FTX didn't even do that properly. When Coindesk revealed Alameda's balance sheet was mostly FTX's own FTT tokens, customers rushed to withdraw.

**November 8, 2022:** FTX processes $5 billion in withdrawal requests. Doesn't have the funds. Exchange collapses within 72 hours. Sam Bankman-Fried indicted for fraud. $8 billion missing.

**The comparison:** Stop of Exchequer = sovereign default causing private banking collapse. FTX = private banking collapse causing depositor ruin directly, no sovereign involved. But same fundamental problem: fractional reserves + confidence loss + no backstop = total failure.

**What Crypto Got Wrong**

Each collapse demonstrates crypto's fundamental error: believing technology eliminates the need for institutions.

- **Terra/Luna:** Algorithm can't create value from nothing (neither could goldsmith paper when gold unavailable)
- **Three Arrows:** Network interconnection amplifies failure (same as 19 goldsmiths with Backwell clearing accounts)
- **Celsius:** Borrowing short/lending long fails during liquidity crisis (Backwell's fundamental equation)
- **FTX:** Fractional reserves without even proper accounting (worse than 1672 goldsmiths who at least kept ledgers)

**The Missing Element:** Every goldsmith collapse in 1672 lacked a lender of last resort. Every crypto collapse in 2022 lacked the same. When confidence breaks, private systems have no mechanism to restore it. The Fed saved shadow banking in 2008. No one could save crypto in 2022 because crypto advocates explicitly rejected institutional backing.

The cryptocurrency community's slogan—"not your keys, not your coins"—inadvertently proves the point. It means: unless you hold private cryptographic keys giving you direct control of digital assets, you're trusting an intermediary who might fail. This is precisely what goldsmith banking taught: bearer receipts worked until the issuer couldn't redeem them. Crypto advocates celebrate eliminating intermediaries, but the FTX collapse revealed that most users don't hold their own keys—they trust exchanges, which function as unregulated goldsmith-banks. When those exchanges fail, there's no Bank of England to step in, no deposit insurance, no lender of last resort. Users simply lose everything.

The goldsmiths were brilliant innovators who created fractional reserve banking and bearer instruments without government authorization. Their system worked beautifully—until it didn't. When crisis came, there was no mechanism to prevent systemic collapse. Crypto innovators have recreated the same system with blockchain technology, convinced that cryptography and decentralization eliminate the need for institutions. But Terra/Luna, Celsius, Voyager, and FTX proved otherwise. Private money can exist, but it cannot provide systemic stability. That requires institutions backed by sovereign fiscal power—institutions that can act when private credit fails, that can guarantee deposits when banks collapse, that can serve as lender of last resort when panic strikes. The lesson of 1672 remains as relevant in the age of Bitcoin as it was in the age of goldsmith receipts: innovation is not enough. Every generation must relearn that stability requires public institutions, not just private ingenuity.

### What 1672 Proved—And What We Keep Forgetting

The Stop of the Exchequer and the collapse of goldsmith banking established four principles that remain true 350 years later:

**1. Private Money Creation CAN Work**

Goldsmith banking operated successfully for 32 years (1640-1672). Fractional reserve banking, bearer receipts, clearing networks—all emerged organically from commercial practice. Credit expansion facilitated London's growth as a commercial center. The innovation wasn't fraudulent; it was efficient. When confidence held, the system worked brilliantly.

The same is true of modern shadow banking (1990s-2008) and cryptocurrency (2009-2022). These systems can function for years, even decades, creating genuine economic value. Private ingenuity can discover sophisticated financial mechanisms. The goldsmiths proved this.

**2. Private Money CANNOT Survive Systemic Shocks Without Public Backstop**

A single sovereign default (Charles II's Stop) destroyed the entire goldsmith banking system within months. Five major banks failed immediately. Nine more were severely undermined. Over 10,000 families ruined. Commerce froze.

Network interconnection amplified individual failures—the 19 goldsmiths maintaining clearing accounts with Backwell all faced losses when he failed. No private institution commanded resources sufficient to stabilize the panic. No mechanism existed for crisis resolution.

The pattern repeats: Terra/Luna collapse (May 2022) triggered Three Arrows Capital (June), which triggered Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi. Each failure amplified the next. No crypto exchange had reserves to backstop the system. The cascade was identical to 1672.

**3. Financial Innovation Doesn't Eliminate Fundamental Constraints**

Goldsmiths invented fractional reserves—discovering that promises to pay on demand could exceed actual reserves as long as not everyone demanded simultaneously. This was genuine innovation, not fraud.

Modern banks added: deposit insurance, central bank support, regulatory oversight. These don't eliminate fractional reserves; they manage the inherent risks.

Crypto added: cryptographic verification, distributed ledgers, algorithmic stablecoins. But FTX still failed the same way Backwell did—promises exceeded reserves, depositors demanded withdrawal, system collapsed.

Technology changes. Clay tablets → paper receipts → digital tokens → blockchain. But the fundamental equation remains: if liabilities (what you promise) exceed assets (what you have), and confidence breaks, you fail. No algorithm can solve this.

**4. Institutional Backing Matters More Than Technical Mechanism**

**1672:** Private goldsmith notes failed. Government-backed exchequer tallies continued circulating.

**2008:** Private shadow banking failed (Bear Stearns, Lehman). Fed-backed commercial banks survived with FDIC insurance and central bank support.

**2022:** Private crypto failed (Terra, Celsius, FTX). Government-backed currencies remained stable.

The difference isn't the technology—it's the institutional backing. Goldsmith receipts were technically sophisticated for 1672. Crypto tokens are technically sophisticated for 2022. Both fail without institutional support when confidence breaks.

**The Lesson for Modern Policy**

When advocates propose "free banking," "algorithmic stablecoins," or financial systems "independent of government," history provides a clear answer: **It's been tried. Repeatedly. It works brilliantly—until it doesn't. And when it doesn't, the carnage is devastating.**

The Bank of England (1694) emerged from goldsmith banking's ashes, providing the institutional framework goldsmith banking lacked: parliamentary backing, lender of last resort function, uniform currency with sovereign guarantee.

The Federal Reserve (1913) emerged from the Free Banking Era's chaos (1837-1863), when unregulated state-chartered banks issued thousands of different banknotes, periodically failed in cascades, and demonstrated again that private money creation without institutional oversight produces instability.

Central bank digital currencies will likely emerge from crypto's failures, demonstrating once more the pattern: **Private innovation proves both the possibility and the necessity of public institutions.**

The fundamental lesson: Stability requires public institutions, not just private ingenuity. Every generation forgets this. The goldsmiths forgot what medieval merchants knew about sovereign foundations beneath credit networks. Crypto forgot what the goldsmiths learned about institutional backing. And the next generation will likely forget what 2022 crypto collapse taught.

But the principle remains constant: Private money can exist. It cannot provide systemic stability. That requires institutions backed by sovereign fiscal power—institutions that can act when private credit fails, that can guarantee deposits when banks collapse, that can serve as lender of last resort when panic strikes. Innovation creates efficiency. Institutions create stability. Both are necessary.

Yet here's the puzzle: if institutional backing is essential, how did the first such institution get built? How did anyone create an institution credible enough to make its promises believable—especially when every previous attempt had failed? The goldsmiths couldn't do it. Medieval merchant houses couldn't do it. Monarchs who'd defaulted for centuries certainly couldn't do it.

The answer came from an unlikely source: a Scottish merchant named William Paterson, desperate to fund King William III's war against France, who proposed something that seemed impossible—a bank that could create money "out of nothing" and make foreign creditors believe in it. The year was 1694. England had just fought a revolution to limit royal power. The king needed £1.2 million immediately—more than the entire annual tax revenue—and every traditional lender had been burned by royal defaults.

Paterson's solution was radical: link the bank's money creation directly to Parliament's power to tax. Not the king's promise. Not gold reserves. Not merchant reputation. Parliamentary taxation—the one thing that had proven reliable since the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The mechanism he designed would become the template for every central bank since, from the Federal Reserve to the European Central Bank.

The next chapter examines that founding moment—how a group of London merchants solved a problem that had plagued European finance for centuries, and why their solution still governs how modern central banks create trillions of dollars with a keystroke.
