# Chapter 04 Sources & Summary

### **Chapter Summary**

Private money creation emerged accidentally in England after Charles I's 1640 seizure of Royal Mint deposits. Goldsmith-bankers began issuing "payable to bearer" receipts that circulated as currency, discovering fractional reserve banking without government authorization. By the 1660s, goldsmith banking dominated London finance, with major bankers like Edward Backwell serving the elite. The Stop of the Exchequer in 1672—Charles II's suspension of £1.3 million in debt payments—destroyed this system catastrophically. Five major banks failed immediately, 10,000 families were ruined, and commerce ground to a halt. The crisis proved that private money creation lacked crisis resolution mechanisms: no lender of last resort, no deposit insurance, no government backstop. The solution would require state intervention—a public institution that could create money with the full backing of parliamentary taxation.
