# PART II: THE INSTITUTIONAL REVOLUTION

## From Private Chaos to Public Credit

The late seventeenth century witnessed a transformation in monetary architecture. Private money creation—the goldsmith-bankers who issued receipts and lent at interest—had proven catastrophically unstable. When Charles II suspended debt payments in 1672, the entire system collapsed. What England needed was not more private ingenuity but a public institution that could create money with the full backing of the state's fiscal power.

The solution emerged from the intersection of constitutional revolution and financial innovation. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 transferred fiscal power from crown to Parliament, making England's debt credible for the first time. The Bank of England's founding in 1694 completed this revolution by creating a mechanism to manufacture credit on demand: lending to government by issuing banknotes backed by parliamentary guarantees.

This Part examines the two-stage process creating modern central banking:

**Chapter 4** tells private money's failure—goldsmith banking collapsed in the 1672 Stop of the Exchequer, proving private money creation couldn't provide systemic stability.

**Chapter 5** reveals how the Bank of England solved the credibility problem by tying its charter to parliamentary taxation, creating an institution that could issue paper money domestically while maintaining gold convertibility internationally.

The institutional revolution was complete: money creation required not gold reserves but institutional credibility backed by the capacity to tax.

Yet this institutional success came at a price. **The Bank of England systematically served creditor interests over debtor interests.** Its tight money policies protected bondholders' real returns through price stability while making credit expensive for manufacturers and workers. The parliamentary settlement that made the system credible reflected the interests of wealthy landowners and merchants who controlled taxation, not the broader population who bore its costs. When modern advocates celebrate the Bank's "success," they often forget whose success it was—bondholders accumulated wealth while farmers struggled with deflationary pressures that would persist for centuries.
