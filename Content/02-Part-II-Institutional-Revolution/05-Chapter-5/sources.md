# Chapter 05 Sources & Summary

### **Chapter Summary**

The Glorious Revolution of 1688 created the institutional foundation for modern central banking by transferring fiscal power from crown to Parliament. Parliamentary control of taxation made England's debt credible for the first time. The Bank of England (1694) completed this revolution by creating a mechanism to manufacture credit on demand: lending £1.2 million to government by issuing banknotes backed by parliamentary guarantees. The Bank's notes circulated domestically because taxes created demand; foreign creditors accepted them because parliamentary taxation demonstrated fiscal capacity. Money creation worked through double-entry bookkeeping: loans created deposits, which when spent and re-deposited, allowed further lending. The perpetual debt structure meant the Bank never needed enough gold to redeem all notes—only enough to maintain confidence in convertibility. A two-tier system emerged with country banks issuing notes convertible to Bank of England money, which alone could pay taxes. France's failure to replicate this success—paying 7-11% interest versus England's 3-5%—proved institutions mattered more than resources. The real revolution was discovering that money is a relationship governed by law, not a commodity backed by metal.
