# PART II: THE INSTITUTIONAL REVOLUTION

## Chapter 5: The Bank of England Solution

**Chapter Premise:** The Bank of England solved the credibility problem by tying its charter to parliamentary taxation, creating money through lending while maintaining gold convertibility for foreign creditors. A two-tier system emerged with country banks pyramiding on Bank of England reserves.

### How Does the Fed Actually Create Money?

"Where does the money come from?" It's the question that stops most policy debates. When Congress proposes infrastructure spending or pandemic relief, critics demand: "How will you pay for it?" The implicit assumption is that government must first collect money—through taxes or borrowing—before it can spend. The government, like a household, must find money before using it.

But what if this is backwards? What if governments that control their own currency create money by spending, not by collecting? What if the Federal Reserve doesn't lend out deposits but creates money through the act of lending itself?

In March 2020, the Fed created $3 trillion in emergency liquidity within weeks. No tax increase. No bond sale to private investors. The Fed simply credited bank accounts with new reserves. Critics called it "printing money." Defenders called it necessary. But few understood the mechanism: the Fed was doing exactly what the Bank of England did in 1694—creating money by making loans, backed not by gold reserves but by the government's power to tax and the institution's credibility.

Understanding how this works requires going back to the invention that made it possible: the Bank of England's solution to the sovereign's dilemma. The mechanism created in 1694 still governs how modern central banks operate. The technology has changed—from handwritten ledgers to digital entries—but the fundamental principle remains: money is created through lending, and its value comes from taxation authority, not from commodity reserves.

**This chapter explains how the Bank of England solved the credibility problem that had plagued monarchs for centuries.** We'll trace the Glorious Revolution's transfer of fiscal power to Parliament, examine how the Bank created money through lending (not by intermediating deposits), and reveal why Parliament accepting Bank notes for taxes created currency demand. The chapter explains the "spend first, tax later" sequence that inverts household logic, describes the two-tier banking system that emerged, and contrasts England's success with France's failures. By the end, you'll understand why taxation—not gold—gives money value, and why this success led to a "great forgetting" of monetary truth.

William's throne came with an immediate price: war. Louis XIV of France, Europe's most powerful monarch, refused to recognize the new regime. England, allied with the Dutch Republic and the Holy Roman Empire, was drawn into the **Nine Years' War** (1688–1697).¹⁵

The numbers were staggering. William needed **£5.5 million annually** at first, rising to **£8.5 million by war's end**—sums that dwarfed any previous English military expenditure. England's traditional revenues brought in barely half that amount. The gap had to be filled by borrowing, and borrowing required something England had never possessed: **institutional credibility**.¹⁶

Parliament's solution was elegant and unprecedented. Every loan to the government would be backed by **specific taxes**, legally earmarked for debt service. Creditors were no longer betting on the king's honesty; they were betting on Parliament's ability to collect revenue. And because Parliament represented the propertied classes—the very people who paid most taxes—it had every incentive to honor its commitments.¹⁷

This principle gave rise to what historians call the **fiscal-military state**: a government capable of borrowing vast sums at relatively low interest because its debts were secured by law, not personality. Between 1688 and 1697, England's national debt grew from nearly nothing to over **£16 million**. Yet interest rates fell, because lenders trusted the new system.¹⁸

The difference was not economic but **constitutional**. England had solved the paradox that had trapped every early modern monarchy: how to borrow without surrendering sovereignty. The answer was to surrender sovereignty—but to Parliament, not to creditors.

### The invention of the Bank

Parliamentary control solved the credibility problem, but England still needed a mechanism to turn future tax revenues into immediate purchasing power.

Yet even with parliamentary backing, England's war finance remained chaotic. Loans were negotiated piecemeal, with different creditors holding different instruments at different rates. What the government needed was a **bank**—not a private goldsmith's shop but a public corporation chartered to serve the state.¹⁹

The idea came from a group of London merchants and financiers, led by William Paterson and Michael Godfrey. Their proposal, presented to Parliament in 1694, was audacious: create a **joint-stock company** that would lend **£1.2 million** to the government at **8 percent interest**. In return, the company would receive a royal charter and the exclusive right to issue **banknotes**.²⁰

The scale was unprecedented. The £1.2 million loan represented approximately **2.0-2.4% of English GDP** and equaled **100% of annual government revenue**. In today's terms, this would be equivalent to roughly **$635 million to $1 billion** in purchasing power. The loan could have paid 60,000 skilled craftsmen for a year or purchased 146 small warships.²¹

The response was astonishing. Over **1,200 individuals**—from nobles and merchants to shopkeepers and widows—subscribed the entire sum in just **eleven days**. Among the subscribers was Thomas Fletcher, a Bristol wool merchant who invested £500, seeing opportunity in this new financial instrument. Yet the mechanics were more complex than they appeared. Investors did not pay the full £1.2 million immediately. Through phased capital calls, only **25 percent** was due at subscription, with another **35 percent** later in 1694. The Bank recorded the actual cash paid in—**£720,000**—under the "Banknote" heading on the balance sheet.²²

### The alchemy of paper: How money creation worked

This is where the story gets counterintuitive. The Bank didn't lend out gold it already had—it created money by making loans.

The mechanics were revolutionary. Investors subscribed capital, and that capital was lent to the state. But the Bank would not simply hand over gold and wait for repayment. Instead, it would issue **notes**: printed promises to pay the bearer on demand. Those notes, backed by the Bank's assets (including the government loan), would enter circulation as a new form of currency.

On the Bank's ledger, the transaction looked like this:

**Assets**: Loan to Government £1.2 million  
**Liabilities**: Banknotes Issued £1.2 million

The loan was the asset; the notes were the liability. When the government spent those notes—paying soldiers, buying supplies, or funding allies—they became **money**, circulating through the economy as purchasing power. The Bank had, in effect, **created money by lending**.²³

Let's be clear about what just happened: **The Bank did not have £1.2 million in a vault**. It did not hand over someone else's deposit. It created brand new money by making two accounting entries: one recording the loan to government (what the Bank is owed) and one recording the notes issued (what the Bank owes). The notes appeared into existence through the act of lending.

This seems impossible. How can you create purchasing power from nothing? The answer is that money is not a physical thing—it's a claim, a promise, a relationship. The Bank promised to exchange its notes for gold on demand (**convertibility**—the ability to exchange paper money for precious metal at a fixed rate). But more importantly, the government promised to accept those notes for taxes. That combination—**convertibility** plus tax acceptability—gave the notes value.

### How Money Multiplication Works

**Understanding How Banks Create Money: A Modern Example First**

Before examining the Bank of England's 1694 innovation, let's see how money creation works using a familiar modern example.

You walk into a bank and get approved for a $10,000 loan. Where does that $10,000 come from? Many people assume the bank is lending out money other customers deposited—like a financial middleman. This is incorrect.

**What actually happens:**

1. **The bank creates $10,000** by typing numbers into your account. This money didn't exist seconds earlier.
2. **You now owe the bank $10,000** (your debt to them—this is an *asset* from the bank's perspective because you'll pay it back with interest)
3. **The bank owes you $10,000** in your account (this is a *liability* from the bank's perspective because you can withdraw it)

The bank's "balance sheet" (its accounting of what it owns and owes) looks like this:

**BANK'S ASSETS** (what others owe them):
- Your loan: $10,000

**BANK'S LIABILITIES** (what bank owes others):  
- Your deposit account: $10,000

Assets ($10,000) = Liabilities ($10,000). The books balance, even though the bank created this money from nothing.

**The key insight:** Banks don't lend out existing money. They create new money by making loans. Your debt to the bank IS the backing for the money in your account.

Now let's see how the Bank of England pioneered this same system in 1694, using paper notes instead of digital entries but following identical logic.

Understanding how the Bank created money explains why government spending doesn't work like household budgets. Think of the Bank's ledger having two columns: assets (what others owe the Bank) and liabilities (what the Bank owes others). When these balance, the system works.

**Double-entry accounting works like a seesaw that must always balance.** When the Bank lends £1.2 million to the government (left side goes up: assets increase), the Bank simultaneously creates £1.2 million in notes (right side goes up: liabilities increase). Both sides rise together—the seesaw stays level. This is why the Bank can create money "out of nothing"—it's not creating something from nothing, but rather creating a matched pair: an asset (loan to government) and a liability (notes promised to holders). The magic isn't defying physics; it's using accounting.

Think of it in simpler terms: **Imagine you write an IOU: "I owe you $20."** That IOU is now an asset to the holder (they can collect $20 from you) and a liability to you (you must pay $20). You created both simultaneously by writing one note. Banks do the same thing at scale, and because their IOUs (bank notes) are accepted as payment, their IOUs function as money. The Bank of England's innovation was getting everyone to accept its IOUs because Parliament required them for taxes.

**Stage 1: The Initial Loan**
The Bank lends £1,000 to government by creating £1,000 in notes.
- Left column: "Government owes us £1,000"
- Right column: "We owe note-holders £1,000"  
Government spends the notes paying soldiers and suppliers.

**Stage 2: The Deposit Returns**
Thomas Fletcher, a wool merchant, receives those notes as payment and deposits them at the Bank. The physical notes return, but the money doesn't disappear—it transforms into a deposit.
- Left column: "Government owes us £1,000" (unchanged)
- Right column: "Fletcher has £1,000 deposit" (transformed)

**Stage 3: The Multiplication**
The Bank now lends £800 to a new borrower, creating £800 in fresh notes.
- Left column adds: "New borrower owes us £800"
- Right column adds: "We owe note-holders £800"
- **Total money now:** £1,800 (Fletcher's £1,000 deposit + £800 new notes)

The original £1,000 has multiplied. It exists simultaneously as the government's outstanding loan, Fletcher's spendable deposit, and new lending capacity. **This isn't fraud**—it's how credit systems work. The Bank isn't lending Fletcher's money. It's creating new money by lending, using Fletcher's deposit as reserve backing.

By the 1780s, the Bank employed approximately 300 clerks maintaining these ledgers—five times more than the Treasury. Clerks recorded every transaction in duplicate, creating an exhaustive paper trail. The system was laborious but revolutionary: it revealed that the same foundational money could support multiple layers of purchasing power through sequential lending and depositing.²⁴

Think of it this way: banks don't work like coat-check rooms, lending out depositors' money. They work like scoreboards. When a bank makes a loan, it creates a new deposit by writing numbers in an account. The constraint is not how much money the bank has—it is whether the borrower will repay and whether people trust the bank's numbers.

A goldsmith who accepted deposits and lent them out was merely intermediating. But a bank that issued its own notes was doing something different: it was **creating new claims** on future production, backed by the borrower's promise to repay and the government's promise to tax. Banks don't lend money; they **create it by lending**.²⁵

        - Customs duties (merchants)
        - Window tax (property owners)

KEY PRINCIPLES:
→ Money created "out of nothing" by accounting entry
→ Sustained by taxation requirement (creates demand)
→ NOT backed by pre-existing gold reserves
→ "Spend first, tax later" sequence (not "tax to fund spending")
→ Constraint is REAL RESOURCES (productive capacity), not finance
```

**Why this diagram matters:**

This is the mechanism that mainstream economics obscured. When politicians say "we're out of money" or "we must raise taxes to afford programs," they're reversing the causal sequence. The government creates money by spending—the Bank's notes entered circulation through government expenditure, not through prior taxation. Taxes don't fund spending; **taxes create demand for what government spends**.

The constraint isn't finance but real resources: inflation occurs when spending exceeds productive capacity, not when it exceeds tax revenue. This was working in 1694 England, and it's how modern sovereign currency-issuing governments operate today (U.S., U.K., Japan)—though the mechanism is systematically misrepresented in public discourse.

### Money Creation in Practice: A Merchant's Experience

To see how this worked in practice, consider Thomas Fletcher—a representative example based on documented Bank of England lending practices.²⁵ᵃ Fletcher, a London cloth merchant, sought to expand his business in 1703.

Fletcher needed £500 to purchase raw wool from Yorkshire and hire additional weavers. Traditional moneylenders charged 15-20% interest—rates that would consume any profit margin. But the Bank of England, holding the government charter and Parliament's backing, could lend at 6%.

Fletcher presented his books to the Bank, demonstrating regular sales and creditworthiness. The Bank's clerk examined his accounts, verified his property as collateral, and approved the loan. What happened next would have seemed miraculous to medieval merchants:

**The Bank created £500 by writing it into their ledger.**

On the Bank's books:
- ASSETS side: "Loan to Thomas Fletcher, £500" (Fletcher owes the Bank)
- LIABILITIES side: "Bank notes issued, £500" (Bank owes bearer these notes)

Fletcher received £500 in Bank of England notes—paper slips promising to pay the bearer on demand. These notes were not backed by £500 in gold sitting in the vault. The Bank held perhaps £100-150 in reserves against this £500 in notes (consistent with documented reserve ratios). The rest was credit—created by the lending process itself.

Fletcher used these notes to:
1. Pay Yorkshire wool suppliers (notes circulated to Yorkshire)
2. Hire weavers (notes circulated to working-class London)
3. Purchase equipment (notes circulated to manufacturers)

Each recipient accepted the notes as money because they knew:
- They could discharge tax obligations with them
- The Bank of England would redeem them for gold if needed (though most never bothered)
- Other merchants would accept them in turn

Fletcher repaid the £500 plus £30 interest (6 percent annually) over two years. The £500 in notes remained in circulation, now backed by new loans to other merchants. The £30 interest compensated the Bank for default risk and covered operating costs.

**This was money creation through credit extension**—the same process modern banks use today when they make loans by typing numbers into accounts. No gold mine needed, no government printing press, just double-entry bookkeeping backed by institutional credibility.

> **Understanding Check:** If the balance sheet mechanics feel confusing, that's completely normal—this is the chapter's most technical concept. The key insight is simple: **banks create money by making accounting entries, not by lending out deposits**. The Bank of England didn't need £1.2 million sitting in a vault to lend £1.2 million to the government. It created that money through the act of lending itself. If you're unclear on the accounting details, continue forward—the implications matter more than the mechanics. You can always return to the Thomas Fletcher example above for a concrete illustration.

### Why It Worked Domestically: Taxation Creates Demand

The Bank's notes circulated in England because **everyone eventually owed the government something**. Thomas Fletcher, our Bristol wool merchant, paid customs duties on his exports. A farmer in Yorkshire paid land tax every year. A gentleman in Bath paid window tax. All these obligations could be satisfied with Bank of England notes.²⁶

This created a perpetual cycle:

1. **The government spent** Bank notes into the economy
2. **The notes circulated** through private transactions
3. **Taxation withdrew** notes from circulation
4. **The government spent again**, reinjecting the notes

The cycle was self-sustaining. The government did not need to hoard gold to create money; it needed only to **spend first and tax later**. The spending created the money; the taxation ensured demand for it.²⁷

**This reveals a fundamental inversion in public discourse.** Politicians claim "we're out of money" and "must raise taxes to afford programs." But the government creates money by spending—the Bank's notes entered circulation through government expenditure, not through prior taxation. Taxes don't fund spending; **taxes create demand for what government spends**. The constraint is not finance but real resources: inflation occurs when spending exceeds productive capacity, not when it exceeds tax revenue.²⁸

Think of it this way: if the government had to collect money before spending, where would the money come from in the first place? The government creates the money by spending it into existence. Taxes ensure that money has value by creating demand for it.

Imagine you are a farmer in 1700s England. You grow wheat, raise sheep, make your own clothes. You could live entirely without money—except for one thing: the tax collector comes every year demanding £5 in Bank of England notes. Not wheat, not sheep, not labor—specifically those paper notes. Suddenly you **need** those notes. You must sell something for notes, or work for someone who pays in notes. The government created demand for its paper by requiring you to pay taxes with it.²⁹

The principle was not new. Adam Smith had articulated it in *The Wealth of Nations* (1776), writing that "a prince, who should enact that a certain proportion of his taxes should be paid in a paper money of a certain kind, might thereby give a certain value to this paper money."³⁰

---

### What taxation is actually for

Understanding that government creates money by spending and uses taxation to create demand transforms how we understand taxation's purpose. Taxation serves three functions—only one of which is widely understood.

**First, taxation creates baseline currency demand** (the technical function). By requiring payment of obligations in the state's currency, government ensures everyone needs that currency. This is why Bank of England notes circulated despite no gold backing for 24 years during the Bank Restriction (1797-1821), and why modern fiat currency holds value despite no commodity backing. The requirement to pay taxes creates guaranteed demand. This function is mechanical and non-negotiable: without it, state currency would not circulate.³⁰ᵃ

**Second, taxation manages inflation by withdrawing purchasing power** (the economic function). When the economy operates at or near full capacity—when factories run at full utilization, labor markets are tight, and supply chains are stretched—additional spending without corresponding taxation risks inflation. Not because government "runs out of money" or "must balance its budget," but because more money chasing the same goods drives prices up. Taxation withdraws money from circulation, reducing aggregate demand and freeing productive capacity for public use. This function is cyclical: during recessions with high unemployment and idle factories, less taxation is needed because productive capacity sits unused. During booms approaching full employment, more taxation prevents overheating. The constraint is real resources, not money.³⁰ᵇ

**Third, taxation redistributes wealth to prevent destabilizing inequality** (the political-moral function). This is contested but has deep historical roots: Mesopotamian debt jubilees (2400 BCE), Biblical Jubilee laws, and Adam Smith's call for subjects to contribute "in proportion to their respective abilities" (progressive taxation). Societies that allowed extreme wealth concentration—Late Roman latifundia, medieval English enclosures—tended toward instability. When asset ownership becomes the primary wealth source rather than productive labor, those without assets face declining relative position. Taxation can redistribute wealth accumulated through rent extraction and inheritance, maintaining balance for social stability. Modern prosperity depends on collectively-created infrastructure, knowledge, and legal systems—no individual earns wealth in isolation. The question is how much redistribution serves stability, not whether it's justified.³⁰ᶜ⁻ᵉ

This transforms fiscal debates. When politicians claim "we must raise taxes to afford infrastructure" or "we can't afford universal healthcare," they invert causation. The sequence is: (1) government identifies unused productive capacity (unemployed workers, idle factories), (2) government spends money into existence to mobilize those resources, (3) if spending risks exceeding capacity and causing inflation, government taxes to withdraw purchasing power and free resources for public use, (4) government may also tax to prevent wealth concentration from becoming destabilizing. The constraint is never money—governments that issue currency create money by spending. The constraints are productive capacity (inflation) and political will (distribution).³⁰ᶠ

> **Note on Modern Monetary Theory (MMT):** The principles described here—that currency-issuing governments spend money into existence and face real resource constraints rather than financial constraints—form the foundation of what contemporary economists call Modern Monetary Theory. MMT isn't a new invention but a formalization of how monetary systems have always worked, as documented throughout this book. We'll explore MMT's contemporary policy implications more fully below and in Chapter 11, but understanding that this 1694 mechanism still governs modern central banking helps explain why MMT describes reality rather than proposing radical reform.

The Bank of England's founding demonstrates this sequence. The government spent £1.2 million into existence by borrowing from the Bank. Those notes circulated because tax obligations created demand. As the economy grew and the money supply needed to expand, the government created more money through additional borrowing and spending. Taxes didn't fund this spending—taxes made this spending valuable by ensuring everyone needed the notes. When modern politicians claim "taxpayer money" funds government programs, they reverse the actual sequence and obscure how monetary systems work.³⁰ᵍ⁻ʰ

---

### The mechanics of permanence

The Bank's power to create money rested on an unusual feature: the government debt was never meant to be repaid.

What made this system work was not the gold in the Bank's vaults but the **permanence** of the debt. The £1.2 million loan was not a short-term advance to be repaid when taxes came in. It was a **perpetual obligation**—a debt that pays interest indefinitely but never requires repayment of the principal. The government would pay 8 percent interest every year, but it would never repay the principal unless it chose to. The Bank's shareholders were not creditors waiting for repayment but rentiers earning steady income from the state's promise to pay.³¹

This structure had profound implications. Because the debt was permanent, the Bank did not need to hold enough gold to redeem all its notes at once. It only needed to maintain confidence that notes were **convertible** (exchangeable for gold on demand)—that anyone who wanted coin could get it. As long as most people preferred the convenience of paper, the Bank could issue far more notes than it held in gold reserves.³²

Within three years, the funding model had evolved. By 1697, the Bank's balance sheet showed that **banknotes and bills outstanding made up the lion's share of its funding sources**—not shareholder capital. The Bank was issuing **non-interest-bearing notes** (essentially free money) to fund **interest-bearing government debt**, capturing the spread as profit.³³

The Bank's charter was not a gift; it was a **bargain** (a negotiated exchange of benefits). In exchange for lending to the government on favorable terms, the Bank received privileges that made it the most powerful financial institution in England. Each charter renewal involved an explicit trade:

- **1697**: The Bank increased its capital by £1 million and received a monopoly clause prohibiting other banks by Act of Parliament
- **1708**: The Bank made a £400,000 interest-free loan and gained a prohibition on partnerships of more than six persons from issuing notes
- **1742**: A £1.6 million interest-free loan reduced the interest rate to 3 percent
- **1800**: A £3 million interest-free loan for six years further extended privileges³⁴

Critically, the loans were **never closed out**. When Parliament nationalised the Bank in 1946, the outstanding balance remained £11,015,100—the same amount that existed in 1834. The debt rolled over indefinitely. This was not a bug but a feature: the permanence of the debt was what made the Bank's notes valuable.³⁵

### Why foreigners accepted it

Domestic circulation was one thing, but England also needed to borrow abroad and trade internationally. Why would foreigners trust paper money?

The genius of the system was that it worked **both domestically and internationally**. At home, the Bank's notes circulated because they were redeemable in coin and accepted for taxes. But why would **foreign creditors** accept this arrangement? Why would a Dutch merchant or a German banker lend to England when the debt was denominated in paper promises?

The answer lay in **parliamentary taxation**. Foreign lenders did not care about the Bank's notes per se; they cared about England's ability to **convert** those notes into gold or goods when needed. And that ability depended on the government's power to tax—what we call **fiscal capacity**: the government's ability to collect taxes and manage public finances. Because Parliament legally controlled taxation, and because Parliament represented the wealthiest subjects, creditors could trust that England would always have the revenue to meet its obligations.³⁶

In other words:
- **Domestically**, taxation made the Bank's notes valuable by creating demand for them
- **Internationally**, taxation made England's promises credible by demonstrating fiscal capacity

This dual function—internal legitimacy and external solvency—was what made Britain's experiment succeed where France's absolutism failed. French kings borrowed more but defaulted often, because they lacked a representative body to secure revenues. England, after 1688, created the opposite model: **limited monarchy, unlimited credit**.³⁷

### The Two-Tier System: Base Money and Private Money

The relationship between Bank of England money and private bank money reveals a pattern that still structures banking today.

While the Bank of England issued its notes, something remarkable happened across England: hundreds of small partnerships—wool merchants in Somerset, ironmasters in Birmingham, cloth traders in Manchester—began issuing their own banknotes.

By 1810, over 700 private banks circulated approximately £22 million in notes. But here's the critical distinction: **these private bank notes derived their value from being convertible into Bank of England notes, which alone could pay taxes**.

Picture a three-tier pyramid:

**Tier 1 (Base Money):** Bank of England notes—the foundational money issued by the central authority that all other forms of money rest upon, accepted by the Exchequer for tax payments  
**Tier 2 (Private Bank Money):** Country bank notes—convertible to Bank of England notes on demand  
**Tier 3 (Reserves):** Gold coin—Bank of England notes convertible to gold

KEY INSIGHT: Private bank money derives value from convertibility
to Bank of England money, which derives value from tax acceptance.
When country banks suspended convertibility, their notes collapsed.
```

The Exchequer would not accept country bank notes for taxes. This wasn't a technicality—it was the foundational distinction between state-backed money and private substitutes. When tax day arrived, country bank notes had to be converted to Bank of England money. This conversion requirement meant country banks held Bank of England notes as reserves, and those reserves ultimately rested on the Bank's gold holdings and the government's fiscal capacity.³⁸

Thomas Fletcher, our Bristol wool merchant, might hold both types of notes. He'd accept country bank notes from local customers because he could convert them to Bank of England notes. But when the tax collector came, he needed Bank of England notes specifically.

The two-tier system proved the taxation principle: country bank notes circulated precisely because they were convertible into Bank of England notes, which could discharge tax obligations. When country banks suspended convertibility during crises, their notes collapsed in value.³⁹

What England had created, accidentally, was the prototype of modern banking: central bank money (Bank of England notes) supporting commercial bank credit creation (country bank notes). The pattern established in the 1700s still structures monetary systems today: central banks provide base money, commercial banks create private money, and the entire system depends on the state's taxation authority making the base money valuable.

### The French counterfactual

England's success becomes clearer when we see France's failure. Despite being larger and wealthier, France couldn't replicate the Bank of England model.

France's failure to replicate England's success reveals why institutions mattered more than resources. France was larger, wealthier, and more populous than England—yet it paid consistently higher interest rates and suffered repeated debt crises. During 1700-1750, England's government bonds yielded 3-5 percent while France paid 7-11 percent.⁴⁰

The root cause was **serial default**. France restructured or repudiated debts in 1634, 1648, 1652, and 1716. England's only comparable default—the 1672 Stop of the Exchequer—was followed by the 1688 constitutional revolution that made future defaults impossible. Post-1690, Britain never repudiated its perpetual debt.⁴¹

Why couldn't France create its own Bank of England? The institutional prerequisites were absent. England's system depended on Parliament's credible commitment. France had no equivalent. John Law's Banque Générale (1716) attempted to replicate the model, but without parliamentary backing it collapsed spectacularly in 1720. Only Napoleon's reforms in 1800, when he chartered the Banque de France with state backing, finally gave France what England had enjoyed since 1690.⁴²

The comparison reveals a fundamental truth: **financial revolutions require political revolutions**. England's advantage was constitutional, not economic.

### The legacy of 1694

By 1700, England had built something unprecedented: a machine for converting institutional credibility into purchasing power.

The Bank of England's founding marked a turning point in monetary history. For the first time, a government had created an institution that could **manufacture credit on demand**, limited only by the need to maintain confidence. The Bank did not discover some hidden reserve of wealth; it **invented** wealth by making promises believable.

This was not alchemy in the mystical sense but in the practical one: the transformation of base materials (paper, ink, and ledgers) into something that functioned as gold. The trick was not in the paper but in the **institutions** that gave it meaning—Parliament's taxing power, the Bank's monopoly charter, and the legal framework that bound them.

Other nations would try to copy the model. Some, like the Netherlands, succeeded. Others, like France, failed because they lacked the constitutional foundations. The difference was always the same: **trust required institutions, and institutions required limits on arbitrary power**. A king who could dissolve Parliament or repudiate debts could never borrow as cheaply as a government that had surrendered those prerogatives.

The Bank of England proved that the future belonged not to the richest states but to the most **credible** ones. And credibility, it turned out, was not a matter of gold reserves but of legal architecture. The real revolution of 1688 was not political but financial: the discovery that **money is a relationship**, and relationships endure only when they are governed by rules no single party can break.

The institutional revolution was complete. England had created a system where money could be manufactured through lending, backed not by gold but by parliamentary taxation and legal obligation. The two-tier structure—Bank of England notes as base money, country bank notes as credit expansion—would become the template for modern monetary systems worldwide. But this very success would create a new problem: as the system worked so well, people would forget how it actually functioned, replacing institutional understanding with gold fetishism. That forgetting, and its consequences, would shape the next two centuries of monetary history.

The Bank of England had solved the impossible problem. By tying money creation to parliamentary taxation, it created institutional credibility that transcended metal. Paper notes circulated because they discharged obligations, not because gold sat in vaults.

This success would prove dangerously seductive. Within a generation, a scientist's arithmetic error would lock Britain—and eventually the world—into a monetary system that obscured this truth for 150 years. The error began with Isaac Newton and a request he considered trivial.

### **Key Concepts—Chapter 5**

**Core Mechanisms:**
- Banks create money through lending (not lending out deposits)
- Taxation creates currency demand (not funding)
- Convertibility maintained confidence but wasn't the value source

**Critical Distinctions:**
- **Fiscal capacity**: government's ability to collect taxes
- **Perpetual obligation**: debt paying interest indefinitely
- Two-tier system: Bank notes vs. country bank notes
- Domestic vs. international: taxation creates both internal demand and external credibility

The Bank of England's success proved a fundamental truth: money works through institutional credibility backed by taxation, not through commodity reserves. For 103 years before the Bank Restriction Act, the Bank had maintained gold convertibility—but that convertibility was a confidence mechanism, not the source of value. The real foundation was Parliament's power to tax and the Bank's demonstrated competence in managing the currency.

This 1694 mechanism—linking money creation to sovereign fiscal capacity—still governs how modern central banks operate. The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan all create money through the same basic principle: institutional credibility sustained by governmental fiscal power. Money is a human institution, not a commodity backed by metal.

Yet within a generation of the Bank's founding, this truth would be systematically obscured. The very success of the system would lead people to mistake the confidence mechanism (gold convertibility) for the actual foundation (institutional credibility and taxation). By the early 19th century, respectable economists would insist that money *must* be backed by gold—that paper currency without metal reserves was inherently unstable and dangerous.

This wasn't the discovery of economic truth. It was the beginning of a great forgetting—an erasure so complete that what William Paterson had stated explicitly in 1694 would become literally unspeakable in respectable economics by 1850.

What was forgotten? Paterson's founding principle: the Bank creates money "out of nothing"—not by lending out deposits, not by accumulating gold, but through the simple act of making loans backed by Parliament's power to tax. Adam Smith had written it plainly in 1776: princes give value to paper money through taxation. The Bank Restriction period (1797-1821) had proven it empirically: Britain financed the Napoleonic Wars on pure fiat currency with no gold backing.

Yet within a generation, these facts became unthinkable. Respectable economists would insist that money *must* be backed by gold, that governments cannot create purchasing power, that taxation funds spending rather than creating currency demand. The beneficiaries were bondholders who profited from deflation—every percentage point of price decline transferred wealth from debtors to creditors. The human cost would be measured in millions of foreclosed farms, starving families, and economic collapse that could have been prevented.

The gold standard era would last from 1821 to 1971—150 years during which this manufactured orthodoxy governed policy. Part III examines how it happened: how gold orthodoxy was embedded in law despite contrary evidence, who profited from the forgetting, and why proof that should have shattered the myth was instead systematically ignored. The story begins with the gold standard's rise to dominance—and the hidden costs that contemporaries couldn't see but that we can measure precisely.
