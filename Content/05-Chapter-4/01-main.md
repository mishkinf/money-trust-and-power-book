# The Glorious Revolution and the Invention of Institutional Money

A cold rain fell on London as William of Orange rode through the city gates in December 1688. He had crossed the Channel with an army, but he would take the throne without a battle. King James II, abandoned by his own officers and nobles, had fled to France. What followed was not merely a change of monarchs but a **constitutional revolution**—a permanent transfer of power from crown to Parliament that would reshape not just England's government but its entire financial system.¹

The settlement was explicit: William and Mary would rule, but only if they accepted Parliament's supremacy. The Bill of Rights (1689) declared that the monarch could not suspend laws, levy taxes, or maintain a standing army without parliamentary consent. For the first time in English history, the power to spend and the power to tax were **legally inseparable**. A king could no longer borrow on his personal credit and leave Parliament to clean up the mess. Every loan, every expenditure, every military campaign would require legislative approval.²

This was not a theoretical nicety. It was a **financial revolution** disguised as a political one. By tying the crown's hands, Parliament made England's debt credible. Lenders no longer had to trust a king's word; they could trust a nation's law.

### The goldsmith catastrophe: Why private money failed

To understand what the Bank of England would become, one must first grasp what existed before it—and why it failed catastrophically. The story begins not with the Glorious Revolution but with a desperate wartime improvisation that would accidentally create England's first private paper money, only to see it collapse in spectacular ruin.

In 1640, **Charles I seized £200,000 from the Royal Mint** to finance his escalating conflicts with Parliament and Scotland. The King's agents simply walked into the Mint, took the money, and left merchants and nobles with worthless receipts. The act destroyed confidence in government storage overnight. Wealthy Londoners who had trusted the crown with their bullion now faced a choice: where could they safely store their wealth?³

The answer came from an unlikely source: the goldsmiths of Lombard Street. These were artisans who worked precious metals—craftsmen like Lawrence Hoare and Edward Backwell—whose workshops had strong vaults for securing their inventory. After 1640, they began accepting deposits of gold and silver, issuing receipts as proof of storage. Initially these were simple warehouse receipts: "Received from John Smith ten pounds sterling in gold coin, to be returned upon presentation of this receipt."⁴

But during the English Civil War (1642-1651), a revolutionary change occurred. Goldsmiths began issuing receipts **"payable to bearer"** rather than to a named individual. This subtle shift transformed the receipts from personal IOUs into something that could circulate throughout London. A merchant receiving a goldsmith receipt in payment didn't need to visit the goldsmith to redeem it—he could simply pass it to the next person. London had accidentally invented **the first true private paper money in English history**.⁵

By the 1660s, goldsmith banking had become the dominant force in London finance. Edward Backwell, originally a goldsmith on Fleet Street, had transformed his business into something resembling a modern bank. His depositors included Charles II himself, the future James II, Samuel Pepys, and the East India Company. Other major goldsmith-bankers—Robert Vyner, Alderman John Coggs, Gilbert Whitehall—competed for the business of England's elite.⁶

More revolutionary still, the goldsmith-bankers discovered **fractional reserve banking** (the practice of holding only a fraction of deposits as reserves while lending out the rest). They realized that not all depositors would demand their gold simultaneously. If £1,000 sat in the vault and only £100 was typically withdrawn in a given week, why not lend £500 to a merchant at interest? The goldsmith would create a new receipt—"payable to bearer on demand"—and give it to the borrower, who would spend it into circulation. The goldsmith had just created money through double-entry bookkeeping: the loan was an asset, the receipt a liability.⁷

Reserve ratios varied wildly. French banker Richard Cantillon, writing in the 1730s, documented ranges from 10 percent to 66 percent across different goldsmith-bankers. There were no regulations, no statutory requirements, no government oversight. The system operated entirely on reputation and market discipline.⁸

**Was this authorized?** No. Goldsmith banking emerged in a legal gray area—no charters, no parliamentary authorization, purely emergent based on commercial practice. This contrasts sharply with chartered institutions like Sweden's Riksbank (1668) or Amsterdam's Wisselbank (1609), which operated under explicit government mandate. English goldsmith receipts represent perhaps the only clear historical case of large-scale private money creation without initial state sanction.⁹

On the morning of **January 2, 1672**, that foundation crumbled. Charles II, desperate for funds to wage the Third Anglo-Dutch War, issued an order suspending repayment of **£1.3 million** owed to the goldsmith-bankers. The **Stop of the Exchequer**, as it became known, was in effect a sovereign default.

Five major goldsmith banks—including Edward Backwell's firm—went bankrupt within weeks. Nine others were severely undermined. Over **10,000 wealthy families** who had deposited money with the goldsmiths or held their receipts were financially ruined. Bishop Gilbert Burnet recorded that "the bankers were broken, and multitudes who had put their money in their hands were ruined by this dishonourable and perfidious action." Commerce in London "ground to a halt" as credit dried up and cash became scarce.¹⁰

Edward Backwell, one of London's leading goldsmith-bankers, learned of the Stop in January 1672. By then the crown owed him approximately £295,994—nearly his entire capital. Backwell's depositors demanded their money. He could not pay them. The "one-year" moratorium was repeatedly extended, dragging on for years. Backwell continued in official service but his bank never recovered liquidity. In 1682 he was declared bankrupt. He died in exile in 1683.¹¹

Legal battles dragged on until 1700—**twenty-eight years**—with only about half of creditors eventually receiving some payment. The eventual recovery rate was approximately 50 percent—but paid out over decades, meaning the real value was far less.¹²

The Stop proved two things. First, goldsmith receipts had become **true money**—otherwise the default wouldn't have caused such catastrophic systemic disruption. Second, and more importantly, the Stop demonstrated the **fatal flaw of unregulated private money**: no crisis resolution mechanism. When the system failed, there was no lender of last resort, no deposit insurance, no government backstop.¹³

The solution, when it finally came in 1694, was **state intervention**. The Bank of England was chartered explicitly to solve the problems the goldsmith catastrophe had revealed: create a stable institutional framework, provide government finance on sound terms, issue uniform currency backed by parliamentary taxation, and offer crisis liquidity when private credit froze.¹⁴

### The cost of legitimacy

William's throne came with an immediate price: war. Louis XIV of France, Europe's most powerful monarch, refused to recognize the new regime. England, allied with the Dutch Republic and the Holy Roman Empire, was drawn into the **Nine Years' War** (1688–1697).¹⁵

The numbers were staggering. William needed **£5.5 million annually** at first, rising to **£8.5 million by war's end**—sums that dwarfed any previous English military expenditure. England's traditional revenues brought in barely half that amount. The gap had to be filled by borrowing, and borrowing required something England had never possessed: **institutional credibility**.¹⁶

Parliament's solution was elegant and unprecedented. Every loan to the government would be backed by **specific taxes**, legally earmarked for debt service. Creditors were no longer betting on the king's honesty; they were betting on Parliament's ability to collect revenue. And because Parliament represented the propertied classes—the very people who paid most taxes—it had every incentive to honor its commitments.¹⁷

This principle gave rise to what historians call the **fiscal-military state**: a government capable of borrowing vast sums at relatively low interest because its debts were secured by law, not personality. Between 1688 and 1697, England's national debt grew from nearly nothing to over **£16 million**. Yet interest rates fell, because lenders trusted the new system.¹⁸

The difference was not economic but **constitutional**. England had solved the paradox that had trapped every early modern monarchy: how to borrow without surrendering sovereignty. The answer was to surrender sovereignty—but to Parliament, not to creditors.

### The invention of the Bank

Yet even with parliamentary backing, England's war finance remained chaotic. Loans were negotiated piecemeal, with different creditors holding different instruments at different rates. What the government needed was a **bank**—not a private goldsmith's shop but a public corporation chartered to serve the state.¹⁹

The idea came from a group of London merchants and financiers, led by William Paterson and Michael Godfrey. Their proposal, presented to Parliament in 1694, was audacious: create a joint-stock company that would lend **£1.2 million** to the government at **8 percent interest**. In return, the company would receive a royal charter and the exclusive right to issue **banknotes**.²⁰

The scale was unprecedented. The £1.2 million loan represented approximately **2.0-2.4% of English GDP** and equaled **100% of annual government revenue**. In today's terms, this would be equivalent to roughly **$635 million to $1 billion** in purchasing power. The loan could have paid 60,000 skilled craftsmen for a year or purchased 146 small warships.²¹

The response was astonishing. The entire sum was subscribed in just **eleven days** by over **1,200 individuals**—from nobles and merchants to shopkeepers and widows. Yet the mechanics were more complex than they appeared. Investors did not pay the full £1.2 million immediately. Through phased capital calls, only **25 percent** was due at subscription, with another **35 percent** later in 1694. The actual cash paid in—**£720,000**—was recorded under the "Banknote" heading on the balance sheet.²²

### The alchemy of paper: How money creation worked

The mechanics were revolutionary. Investors subscribed capital, and that capital was lent to the state. But the Bank would not simply hand over gold and wait for repayment. Instead, it would issue **notes**: printed promises to pay the bearer on demand. Those notes, backed by the Bank's assets (including the government loan), would enter circulation as a new form of currency.

On the Bank's ledger, the transaction looked like this:

**Assets**: Loan to Government £1.2 million  
**Liabilities**: Banknotes Issued £1.2 million

The loan was the asset; the notes were the liability. When the government spent those notes—paying soldiers, buying supplies, or funding allies—they became **money**, circulating through the economy as purchasing power. The Bank had, in effect, **created money by lending**.²³

To manage this revolutionary system, the Bank developed unprecedented institutional capacity. By the 1780s, approximately **300 clerks** maintained detailed asset-liability ledgers—**five times more** than the Treasury employed. These men worked in shifts, recording every transaction in duplicate. The system was exhaustive and exhausting. A single loan to the government might generate dozens of entries as the money moved through the economy, returned to the Bank as deposits, and was lent out again.²⁴

The ledgers revealed something that contemporaries struggled to articulate: **the same money could exist in multiple places simultaneously**. When the government spent a Bank note and the recipient deposited it back at the Bank, the note disappeared from circulation—but the money did not. The Bank recorded a new liability (the deposit) and could lend against it, creating a fresh note. The original government loan remained on the books; the new note represented additional purchasing power. Money had **multiplied** through the act of lending and re-depositing.²⁵

This was not fraud. It was the natural consequence of treating money as **credit** rather than commodity. Think of it this way: banks don't work like coat-check rooms, lending out depositors' money. They work like scoreboards. When a bank makes a loan, it creates a new deposit by writing numbers in an account. The constraint is not how much money the bank has—it is whether the borrower will repay and whether people trust the bank's numbers.

A goldsmith who accepted deposits and lent them out was merely intermediating. But a bank that issued its own notes was doing something different: it was **creating new claims** on future production, backed by the borrower's promise to repay and the government's promise to tax. Banks don't lend money; they **create it by lending**.²⁶

### Why it worked domestically: Taxation creates demand

The Bank's notes circulated in England because **everyone eventually owed the government something**. A farmer in Yorkshire paid land tax every year. A merchant in Bristol paid customs duties. A gentleman in Bath paid window tax. All these obligations could be satisfied with Bank of England notes.²⁷

This created a perpetual cycle:

1. **The government spent** Bank notes into the economy
2. **The notes circulated** through private transactions
3. **Taxation withdrew** notes from circulation
4. **The government spent again**, reinjecting the notes

The cycle was self-sustaining. The government did not need to hoard gold to create money; it needed only to **spend first and tax later**. The spending created the money; the taxation ensured demand for it.²⁸

**This reveals a fundamental inversion in public discourse.** Politicians claim "we're out of money" and "must raise taxes to afford programs." But the government creates money by spending—the Bank's notes entered circulation through government expenditure, not through prior taxation. Taxes don't fund spending; **taxes create demand for what government spends**. The constraint is not finance but real resources: inflation occurs when spending exceeds productive capacity, not when it exceeds tax revenue.²⁹

Imagine you are a farmer in 1700s England. You grow wheat, raise sheep, make your own clothes. You could live entirely without money—except for one thing: the tax collector comes every year demanding £5 in Bank of England notes. Not wheat, not sheep, not labor—specifically those paper notes. Suddenly you **need** those notes. You must sell something for notes, or work for someone who pays in notes. The government created demand for its paper by requiring you to pay taxes with it.³⁰

The principle was not new. Adam Smith had articulated it in *The Wealth of Nations* (1776), writing that "a prince, who should enact that a certain proportion of his taxes should be paid in a paper money of a certain kind, might thereby give a certain value to this paper money."³¹

### The mechanics of permanence

What made this system work was not the gold in the Bank's vaults but the **permanence** of the debt. The £1.2 million loan was not a short-term advance to be repaid when taxes came in. It was a **perpetual obligation**. The government would pay 8 percent interest every year, but it would never repay the principal unless it chose to. The Bank's shareholders were not creditors waiting for their money back; they were rentiers earning a steady income from the state's promise to pay.³²

This structure had profound implications. Because the debt was permanent, the Bank did not need to hold enough gold to redeem all its notes at once. It only needed to maintain confidence that notes were **convertible**—that anyone who wanted coin could get it. As long as most people preferred the convenience of paper, the Bank could issue far more notes than it held in specie.³³

Within three years, the funding model had evolved. By 1697, the Bank's balance sheet showed that **banknotes and bills outstanding made up the lion's share of its funding sources**—not shareholder capital. The Bank was issuing **non-interest-bearing notes** (essentially free money) to fund **interest-bearing government debt**, capturing the spread as profit.³⁴

The Bank's charter was not a gift; it was a **bargain**. In exchange for lending to the government on favorable terms, the Bank received privileges that made it the most powerful financial institution in England. Each charter renewal involved an explicit trade:

- **1697**: The Bank increased its capital by £1 million and received a monopoly clause prohibiting other banks by Act of Parliament
- **1708**: The Bank made a £400,000 interest-free loan and gained a prohibition on partnerships of more than six persons from issuing notes
- **1742**: A £1.6 million interest-free loan reduced the interest rate to 3 percent
- **1800**: A £3 million interest-free loan for six years further extended privileges³⁵

Critically, the loans were **never closed out**. When the Bank was nationalised in 1946, the outstanding balance was still £11,015,100—the same amount that had existed in 1834. The debt rolled over indefinitely. This was not a bug but a feature: the permanence of the debt was what made the Bank's notes valuable.³⁶

### Why foreigners accepted it

The genius of the system was that it worked **both domestically and internationally**. At home, the Bank's notes circulated because they were redeemable in coin and accepted for taxes. But why would **foreign creditors** accept this arrangement? Why would a Dutch merchant or a German banker lend to England when the debt was denominated in paper promises?

The answer lay in **parliamentary taxation**. Foreign lenders did not care about the Bank's notes per se; they cared about England's ability to **convert** those notes into gold or goods when needed. And that ability depended on the government's power to tax. Because Parliament legally controlled taxation, and because Parliament represented the wealthiest subjects, creditors could trust that England would always have the revenue to meet its obligations.³⁷

In other words:
- **Domestically**, taxation made the Bank's notes valuable by creating demand for them
- **Internationally**, taxation made England's promises credible by demonstrating fiscal capacity

This dual function—internal legitimacy and external solvency—was what made Britain's experiment succeed where France's absolutism failed. French kings borrowed more but defaulted often, because they lacked a representative body to secure revenues. England, after 1688, created the opposite model: **limited monarchy, unlimited credit**.³⁸

### The two-tier system emerges

Yet the Bank of England's notes were only part of England's money supply. By the early 1700s, a parallel system had emerged spontaneously across provincial England: **country banks** issuing their own paper currency. These were independent private partnerships—wool merchants in Somerset, ironmasters in Birmingham, cloth traders in Manchester—who discovered they could issue promissory notes that circulated as money in their local communities.³⁹

The proliferation was extraordinary. By 1784, over 100 country banks operated. By 1810, more than 700 banks issued approximately £22 million in notes—compared to the Bank of England's smaller circulation.⁴⁰

But here is the crucial point: **country bank notes derived their value from convertibility into Bank of England notes, which alone could pay taxes**. This created a hierarchy:

**Tier 1**: Bank of England notes (accepted by Exchequer for tax payments)  
**Tier 2**: Country bank notes (convertible to Bank of England notes on demand)  
**Tier 3**: Gold coin (Bank of England notes convertible to gold)

The Exchequer accepted Bank of England notes for tax payments but not country bank notes. When tax day arrived, country bank notes had to be converted into Bank of England money. Country banks held correspondent relationships with London banks, which in turn held accounts at the Bank of England.⁴¹

This two-tier system did not contradict the principle that taxation drives money demand—it **proved** it. Country bank notes circulated precisely because they were convertible into Bank of England notes, which alone could discharge tax obligations. When country banks suspended convertibility during crises, their notes collapsed in value.⁴²

### The French counterfactual

France's failure to replicate England's success reveals why institutions mattered more than resources. France was larger, wealthier, and more populous than England—yet it paid consistently higher interest rates and suffered repeated debt crises. During 1700-1750, England's government bonds yielded 3-5 percent while France paid 7-11 percent.⁴³

The root cause was **serial default**. France restructured or repudiated debts in 1634, 1648, 1652, and 1716. England's only comparable default—the 1672 Stop of the Exchequer—was followed by the 1688 constitutional revolution that made future defaults impossible. Post-1690, Britain never repudiated its perpetual debt.⁴⁴

France's tax system compounded the problem. The crown outsourced collection to tax farmers who kept 30-40 percent of gross receipts as profit. Only 60-70 percent of nominal taxes reached the treasury. England's parliamentary system collected taxes through salaried officials at 3-5 percent cost, with nearly all revenue reaching the Treasury.⁴⁵

Why couldn't France create its own Bank of England? The institutional prerequisites were absent. England's system depended on Parliament's credible commitment. France had no equivalent. John Law's Banque Générale (1716) attempted to replicate the model, but without parliamentary backing it collapsed spectacularly in 1720.⁴⁶

Only Napoleon's reforms provided the institutional foundation France had lacked. In 1800, he chartered the Banque de France with state backing, finally giving France what England had enjoyed since 1690.⁴⁷

The comparison reveals a fundamental truth: **financial revolutions require political revolutions**. England's advantage was constitutional, not economic.

### The legacy of 1694

The Bank of England's founding marked a turning point in monetary history. For the first time, a government had created an institution that could **manufacture credit on demand**, limited only by the need to maintain confidence. The Bank did not discover some hidden reserve of wealth; it **invented** wealth by making promises believable.

This was not alchemy in the mystical sense but in the practical one: the transformation of base materials (paper, ink, and ledgers) into something that functioned as gold. The trick was not in the paper but in the **institutions** that gave it meaning—Parliament's taxing power, the Bank's monopoly charter, and the legal framework that bound them.

Other nations would try to copy the model. Some, like the Netherlands, succeeded. Others, like France, failed because they lacked the constitutional foundations. The difference was always the same: **trust required institutions, and institutions required limits on arbitrary power**. A king who could dissolve Parliament or repudiate debts could never borrow as cheaply as a government that had surrendered those prerogatives.

The Bank of England proved that the future belonged not to the richest states but to the most **credible** ones. And credibility, it turned out, was not a matter of gold reserves but of legal architecture. The real revolution of 1688 was not political but financial: the discovery that **money is a relationship**, and relationships endure only when they are governed by rules no single party can break.

### **Chapter Summary**

The Glorious Revolution of 1688 created the institutional foundation for modern central banking by transferring fiscal power from crown to Parliament. Parliamentary control of taxation made England's debt credible for the first time. The Bank of England (1694) completed this revolution by creating a mechanism to manufacture credit on demand: lending £1.2 million to government by issuing banknotes backed by parliamentary guarantees. The Bank's notes circulated domestically because taxes created demand; foreign creditors accepted them because parliamentary taxation demonstrated fiscal capacity. Money creation worked through double-entry bookkeeping: loans created deposits, which when spent and re-deposited, allowed further lending. The perpetual debt structure meant the Bank never needed enough gold to redeem all notes—only enough to maintain confidence in convertibility. A two-tier system emerged with country banks issuing notes convertible to Bank of England money, which alone could pay taxes. France's failure to replicate this success—paying 7-11% interest versus England's 3-5%—proved institutions mattered more than resources. The real revolution was discovering that money is a relationship governed by law, not a commodity backed by metal.
