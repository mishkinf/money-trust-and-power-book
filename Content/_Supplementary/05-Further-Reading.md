Kelton explains how sovereign currency issuers face different constraints than households, why taxation drives currency demand, and how real resources (not finance) limit economies. Accessible to general readers while maintaining theoretical rigor.

### **L. Randall Wray, *Modern Money Theory: A Primer on Macroeconomics for Sovereign Monetary Systems* (2012)**
Comprehensive academic introduction synthesizing chartalist tradition (Knapp, Mitchell-Innes, Keynes) with functional finance (Lerner) and endogenous money (Minsky, Moore). Best systematic treatment of how taxation creates currency demand and government finance operates under fiat money.

### **Warren Mosler, *Soft Currency Economics* (1993)**
Founding document of MMT, written by hedge fund manager from direct experience in monetary operations. Short, direct, operationally precise. Shows how practical trading experience can generate correct monetary theory independent of academic tradition.

### **Georg Friedrich Knapp, *The State Theory of Money* (1905, English trans. 1924)**

## **ON THE CREDIT THEORY OF MONEY**

### **David Graeber, *Debt: The First 5,000 Years* (2011)**
Anthropological tour de force arguing money emerged from social obligations, not barter. Graeber traces credit systems from Mesopotamian temples through medieval tallies to modern finance.

Surprisingly readable for century-old economic theory; directly influenced modern credit theorists. Available in *Banking Law Journal* archives.

### **L. Randall Wray, *Modern Money Theory* (2012)**
Comprehensive introduction to MMT's credit view of money. Wray traces how taxation creates demand for fiat currency and explains government finance through lens of state money.
