# Glossary of Monetary Terms

---

### **Aerarium**
The Roman state treasury. Maintained detailed accounts of tax revenues and public expenditures, demonstrating continuity of credit-based accounting from ancient temples through classical civilization.

### **Agio**
Premium or fee charged for exchanging one currency for another. The Amsterdam Wisselbank's banco guilder traded at 4-5% agio over physical coins, reflecting its superior reliability and convenience.

### **Amargi**
Ancient Sumerian term meaning "return to mother" or "freedom." Debt cancellation proclamations issued periodically by Mesopotamian rulers to prevent debt bondage and social collapse. Early evidence that money was a political technology requiring periodic resets to maintain stability.

### **Arbitrage**
Profiting from price differences in different markets. Under bimetallic systems, merchants could exploit differences in gold-silver ratios between countries, driving undervalued metal out of circulation (Gresham's Law).

### **Assignat**
Paper currency issued by revolutionary France (1789–1797), initially backed by confiscated church lands. Massive overissuance led to hyperinflation; replaced at 30:1 ratio. Cautionary example of fiat money without institutional discipline.

### **Bancor**
Supranational currency proposed by John Maynard Keynes at Bretton Woods (1944). Would have been issued by International Clearing Union, defined in gold but not convertible to it. Rejected by U.S. in favor of dollar-based system. Name from French "banque or" (bank gold).

### **Bank Restriction Act (1797)**
British law suspending the Bank of England's obligation to redeem notes in gold during Napoleonic Wars. Lasted 24 years (1797–1821), proving paper money could function in wartime without metal backing if institutions remained credible.

### **Bills of Exchange**
Credit instruments used by merchants to settle debts in distant cities without moving gold. Pioneered by Italian banking families in medieval period; became backbone of 18th-19th century international trade when centered in London.

### **Bretton Woods System**
International monetary regime (1944–1971) that fixed exchange rates by pegging currencies to U.S. dollar (±1%) and dollar to gold ($35/oz). Collapsed when U.S. abandoned gold convertibility in 1971.

### **Central Bank**
Institution that manages a nation's currency, money supply, and monetary policy. Early examples include Sweden's Riksbank (1668), Bank of England (1694), and Banque de France (1800). Modern central banks typically have monopoly on currency issuance and act as lender of last resort.

### **Chartalism**
Theory that money's value derives from state's power to impose taxes payable in that currency, not from intrinsic commodity value. Articulated by Georg Friedrich Knapp (1905), adopted by Keynes (1930), and forms foundation of Modern Monetary Theory. From Latin *charta* (token).

### **Commodity Money**
Currency whose value derives from the material it contains (gold, silver, etc.). Contrasts with credit money or fiat money, whose value depends on institutional backing and acceptance.

### **Country Banks**
Private partnerships (1700-1844) that issued their own banknotes across England. Over 700 existed by 1810, creating most of Britain's money supply and financing Industrial Revolution. Prohibited from issuing new notes by Bank Charter Act 1844; last private note issued 1921.

### **Deposit Creation**
Process by which commercial banks create money when making loans. Bank credits borrower's account with new deposit without transferring existing funds—"loans create deposits." Confirmed empirically by Richard Werner (2014) and Bank of England (2014), refuting money multiplier theory.

### **Consols**
British government perpetual bonds (consolidated annuities) paying fixed interest indefinitely with no maturity date. Became benchmark for British government debt in 18th-19th centuries; low rates demonstrated Parliament's credibility as borrower.

### **Debasement**
Reducing precious metal content in coins while maintaining face value. Common practice of medieval and early modern monarchs facing fiscal pressure; typically destroyed currency credibility and led to inflation.

### **Fiat Money**
Currency not backed by physical commodity; derives value from government decree and institutional credibility. All major currencies have been pure fiat since 1971. From Latin *fiat* ("let it be done").

### **Financial Revolution**
Term for England's late 17th-century transformation of public finance following Glorious Revolution (1688). Parliament gained control of taxation and borrowing, created Bank of England (1694), and established funded public debt backed by parliamentary taxes.

### **Endogenous Money**
Theory that money supply is determined by demand for credit, not by central bank control of reserves. Banks create deposits when making loans; central banks accommodate by supplying reserves at target interest rate. Articulated by Post-Keynesian economists (Kaldor, Moore, Minsky); confirmed by Bank of England 2014.

### **Florin**
Gold coin first minted by Florence in 1252 at 3.5 grams pure gold. Never debased; became trusted international currency alongside Venetian ducat. Example of how stable currencies spread through market competition.

### **Fractional Reserve Banking**
System where banks hold only fraction of deposits as reserves, lending out remainder. Creates money through credit expansion. Discovered accidentally by English goldsmith-bankers (1640s-1670s). Modern banks create deposits directly through lending, not by "multiplying" reserves.

### **Functional Finance**
Economic doctrine (Abba Lerner, 1943) that government should judge fiscal policy by economic effects, not budget balance. Government should spend enough to buy all producible goods, can create money to meet obligations, and taxes control inflation rather than "fund" spending. Briefly influential 1940s-1960s; marginalized after stagflation.

### **Gold Standard**
Monetary system where currency value is defined by fixed weight of gold; paper money freely convertible to gold at that rate. Classical gold standard (1870–1914) featured automatic adjustment of trade imbalances through specie flows. Provided long-run price stability but limited domestic policy flexibility.

### **Hierarchy of Money**
Framework (Stephanie Kelton, 2001) showing state-issued currency sits atop pyramid, with bank deposits second tier, and private credit instruments below. Position in hierarchy determined by acceptability—state money most acceptable because required for tax payments. Explains why private money creation depends on state foundation.

### **Household Budget Metaphor**
Misleading analogy treating government finances like household budgets. Popularized by Margaret Thatcher ("housewife's purse") and Ronald Reagan. Obscures that sovereign currency issuers face different constraints than currency users—governments that issue own money cannot "run out" but face inflation and real resource limits instead.

### **Glorious Revolution (1688)**
Overthrow of English King James II by Parliament, installing William III and Mary II under constitutional constraints. Shifted sovereignty from monarch to Parliament, transformed public finance by tying royal borrowing to parliamentary taxation.

### **Lender of Last Resort**
Central bank function of providing emergency liquidity to financial institutions during crises. Prevents bank runs from becoming systemic failures; key feature distinguishing central banks from earlier banking arrangements.

### **Mint Ratio**
Official price at which mint exchanges gold for silver (or vice versa). Isaac Newton's 1717 undervaluation of silver relative to gold accidentally drove silver from circulation and placed Britain on gold standard.

### **Open Market Operations**
Central bank buying/selling of government securities to influence money supply and interest rates. Primary tool of modern monetary policy under fiat currency regime.

### **Parliamentary Sovereignty**
Principle that Parliament is supreme lawmaking authority. In British context, established by Glorious Revolution; crucial for credible public debt because lenders knew Parliament controlled taxation.

### **Reserve Ratio**
Fraction of deposits that banks must hold as reserves (cash or central bank deposits). Tool for controlling money supply; higher ratios constrain credit creation.

### **Seigniorage**
Profit from issuing currency—difference between face value and production cost. Historically a revenue source for sovereigns; under fiat money, represents government's ability to create purchasing power through money creation.

### **Specie**
Coined money made of precious metal (gold or silver). Under gold standard, "specie flows" between countries automatically adjusted trade imbalances as metal moved to settle accounts.

### **Tally Sticks**
Split wooden rods used by English Exchequer (from ~1100) to record tax payments and loans. Each stick notched to show amount and split lengthwise; debtor and creditor each held matching piece. Could circulate as state-backed credit instrument.

### **Taxation-Driven Money**
Concept (prominent in Modern Monetary Theory) that fiat currency derives value from government's requirement that taxes be paid in it. Creates baseline demand independent of currency's intrinsic worth; explains how domestic credit instruments like tally sticks maintained value.

### **Temple Ledgers**
Clay tablets used by ancient Mesopotamian temples and palaces to record grain debts and credits. Earliest form of money-as-accounting; demonstrates credit preceded commodity money by millennia.

### **Jiaozi**
World's first government-issued paper currency, introduced by Song Dynasty China (1023 CE). Government mandated use in tax payments—early fiat system operating centuries before European paper money. By 1204, 4.14 million notes circulated backed by only 700,000 coins.

### **Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)**
Economic framework synthesizing chartalist tradition (Knapp, Mitchell-Innes, Keynes) with functional finance (Lerner) and endogenous money (Minsky, Moore). Core insights: taxation drives currency demand, sovereign issuers can't run out of own money, real resources (not finance) constrain economies. Founded by Warren Mosler (1993); developed by Wray, Kelton, Mitchell.

### **Monetary Sovereignty**
Condition where government issues its own currency, sets tax obligations in that currency, and faces no external convertibility requirement. Sovereign issuers (U.S., Japan, UK) face different constraints than currency users or countries with foreign-currency debt. Central to MMT framework.

### **Money Multiplier**
Discredited theory that banks "multiply" central bank reserves through sequential lending. Taught in textbooks for decades despite being empirically false. Bank of England (2014) confirmed banks create deposits directly when lending, not by multiplying reserves. Reserves supplied by central bank to accommodate lending, not constrain it.

### **Quantitative Easing (QE)**
Central bank purchases of government bonds and other assets to expand money supply when interest rates near zero. Fed's balance sheet grew from $870 billion (2007) to $4.5 trillion (2015). Despite massive expansion, core inflation remained below 2%—demonstrating productive capacity, not money quantity, constrains inflation.

### **Real Bills Doctrine**
Discredited theory that money supply can't be excessive if backed by "real" commercial transactions. Adam Smith's "water-pond" metaphor (1776) suggested self-liquidating trade bills automatically regulate currency. Henry Thornton (1802) demolished doctrine by showing interest rates matter. Enshrined in Federal Reserve Act (1913), contributed to Great Depression.

### **Shadow Banking**
Financial institutions and instruments creating money-like liabilities outside traditional banking regulation. Includes repo markets, money market funds, asset-backed commercial paper, securitization. Reached $20 trillion by 2007, exceeding traditional banking. Collapse triggered 2008 crisis.

### **Triffin Dilemma**
Contradiction in reserve currency system identified by Robert Triffin (1959): reserve currency country must run deficits to supply global liquidity, but those deficits eventually undermine confidence in currency. Predicted Bretton Woods collapse; U.S. dollar liabilities exceeded gold reserves by 1960s, leading to Nixon's 1971 decision.

### **Unit of Account**
Function of money as standard measure of value. Can exist independently of physical medium; ancient societies measured value in silver shekels by weight long before coinage.

### **Usury**
Charging interest on loans, forbidden by medieval Church law as sinful. Merchants circumvented prohibition through bills of exchange that disguised interest as "exchange fees." Protestant Reformation (especially Calvin) reinterpreted interest as legitimate "rent on capital," enabling modern finance.

### **Austrian School**
School of economic thought emphasizing individual choice, spontaneous market order, and commodity origins of money. Founded by Carl Menger (1871); Ludwig von Mises's Regression Theorem (1912) argued money must originate from commodity with prior use-value, contradicting chartalist state-creation theory.

### **Bimetallic System**
Monetary system using both gold and silver as legal currency at fixed ratio. Isaac Newton's 1717 guinea revaluation accidentally overvalued gold relative to silver, driving silver from circulation and placing Britain on de facto gold standard by 1770s.

### **Bullion**
Precious metal in bulk form (bars or ingots), not yet coined. Amsterdam Wisselbank accepted bullion deposits and credited accounts in standardized banco guilders, creating early form of bank money independent of physical coins.

### **Canon Law**
Church legal system governing religious and moral matters. Canon lawyers (Church legal scholars) eventually accepted bills of exchange as legitimate despite usury prohibitions, enabling medieval merchant finance.

### **Clearing**
Process of settling mutual debts by offsetting claims rather than moving actual money. Antwerp and Amsterdam merchant bankers met weekly to "strike the books," canceling debts and paying only residual differences—ancestors of modern clearinghouses.

### **Convertibility**
Ability to exchange paper money for commodity (usually gold) at fixed rate. Bank Restriction Act (1797-1821) suspended convertibility, proving paper could function without metal backing. Nixon ended dollar-gold convertibility in 1971, completing transition to pure fiat.

### **Corvée Labor**
Unpaid labor owed to lord or state as form of taxation. Medieval peasants paid dues "in kind"—grain, wool, or corvée days worked on lord's fields—demonstrating money's role as unit of account even when physical currency scarce.

### **Exchequer**
Royal treasury and accounting office in medieval England. Used tally sticks to record tax payments and loans; name derives from checkered cloth on which accounts were calculated with counters.

### **Fiscal Capacity**
Government's ability to collect taxes and manage public finances. Parliamentary control of taxation after 1688 gave England superior fiscal capacity compared to absolutist France, enabling cheaper borrowing despite smaller economy.

### **GDP (Gross Domestic Product)**
Total value of goods and services produced in economy. Used to measure economic size and compare debt burdens across time. Bank of England's 1694 loan of £1.2 million represented approximately 2% of English GDP.

### **Giro Transfer**
Direct transfer between accounts without physical money moving. Medieval merchant families balanced debts through giro in common ledgers, transforming money from matter into information transmitted by courier.

### **Gold Convertibility**
Ability to exchange paper money for fixed amount of gold. Bank of England suspended in 1797 to finance Napoleonic Wars; restored 1821. U.S. ended foreign official convertibility in 1971, completing global transition to fiat money.

### **Gold Points**
Exchange rate limits where gold shipment becomes profitable. Under classical gold standard (1870-1914), gold points typically ranged 0.4-1.4% of par value. Within gold points, exchange rates fluctuated; outside them, gold flowed automatically to correct imbalances.

### **Gold Window**
System where foreign governments could exchange dollars for gold at fixed rate ($35/oz). Core of Bretton Woods (1944-1971). Nixon closed gold window August 15, 1971, when U.S. gold reserves insufficient to meet conversion demands.

### **Gresham's Law**
Principle that overvalued money drives undervalued money out of circulation. When two forms of money circulate at fixed ratio differing from market value, arbitrage drives out the undervalued form. Named for Thomas Gresham (1519-1579); mechanism explains how Newton's 1717 guinea revaluation drove silver from England.

### **In Kind**
Payment with goods or services rather than money. Medieval peasants paid taxes in kind (grain, wool, labor). Demonstrates money's function as unit of account can exist independently of physical currency.

### **Liquidity**
Readily available money or assets quickly convertible to cash. Central banks act as lender of last resort, providing emergency liquidity during crises to prevent bank runs from becoming systemic failures.

### **Metallist School**
Economists believing money must originate from commodity value. Mises's Regression Theorem presents logical argument that credit money impossible without prior commodity money. Contradicts chartalist view that state authority creates money through taxation.

### **Procyclical Policy**
Policy amplifying economic cycles rather than dampening them. Real Bills Doctrine prescribed procyclical monetary policy: as production fell during Great Depression, "needs of trade" legitimately declined, so Fed contracted money supply—deepening the crisis catastrophically.

### **Regression Theorem**
Ludwig von Mises's 1912 argument that money's value today depends on yesterday's value, traced back to original commodity use. Presents logical challenge to chartalist theory: how does purely abstract money acquire initial value? Chartalist answer: state power to tax creates value from start.

### **Sticky Wages**
Wages that don't adjust quickly to economic changes. Henry Thornton (1802) warned that rapid monetary contraction creates "unusual and temporary distress" because prices and wages don't adjust instantly—deflation causes real economic pain.

### **Tax-Farming**
Selling right to collect taxes to private contractors who keep portion as profit. French monarchy relied on tax farmers (*fermiers généraux*) who kept 30-40% of gross receipts. England's parliamentary system collected taxes through salaried officials at 3-5% cost—superior fiscal capacity despite smaller economy.
