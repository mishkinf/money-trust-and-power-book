# Timeline: Five Millennia of Money
*From Temple Ledgers to Digital Currency*

---

## ANCIENT WORLD (3000 BCE – 600 BCE)

### ~3000 BCE: Temple Ledgers in Mesopotamia
Sumerian temples in Uruk record grain debts and credits on clay tablets. Money begins not as coins but as accounting—credit precedes commodity. Scribes measure value in shekels of silver by weight, though few ever touch the metal itself.

### ~2400 BCE: Debt Jubilees (*Amargi*)
Babylonian rulers periodically cancel debts to prevent social collapse. These "clean slate" proclamations reveal that early money was a political technology of control, not a spontaneous market medium.

### ~2100 BCE: Code of Ur-Nammu
First written legal code regulates loans and interest rates, confirming state control over credit relations from civilization's earliest days.

### ~1200 BCE: Chinese Tribute Systems
Zhou Dynasty establishes elaborate registers of land rent and tribute, laying foundation for state-managed accounting that would persist for millennia.

### ~600 BCE: First Coined Money (Lydia)
Kingdom of Lydia strikes first standardized coins—electrum stamped with royal lion. Coinage emerges to bridge zones of unfamiliarity, allowing trade across political boundaries where credit instruments fail.

---

## MEDIEVAL PERIOD (1100 – 1600)

### 780 CE: Song Dynasty Tax Reforms
Chancellor Yang Yan increases portion of taxes payable in currency versus commodities, deliberately creating demand for money. First explicit policy linking taxation to monetization.

### ~1100: English Tally Sticks
Henry I's Exchequer begins using split hazel rods to record tax payments. Notched and split lengthwise, each tally creates matching records for debtor and creditor. Tallies circulate as payment and are redeemed for taxes—state-backed credit without paper.

### 1023: Song Dynasty Paper Money
Chinese government nationalizes production of *jiaozi* banknotes and mandates their use in tax payments. World's first government-issued paper currency, operating as effective fiat system centuries before Europe.

### 1252: Florentine Gold Florin
Florence mints florin at 3.5 grams pure gold, never debased. Alongside Venice's ducat (1284), it becomes trusted international currency. Stable coins spread by market competition; debased currencies are shunned.

### 1300s: Italian Bills of Exchange
Medici, Bardi, and Peruzzi banking houses create bills of exchange—paper instruments allowing merchants to pay in distant cities without moving gold. Early credit networks parallel to physical coin.

---

## THE FINANCIAL REVOLUTION (1688 – 1750)

### 1609: Amsterdam Wisselbank Founded
Amsterdam city council establishes public bank to solve currency chaos (500+ coins circulating). Introduces bank money (banco guilder) and book-entry transfers—revolutionary payment system that makes Dutch guilder European reserve currency for two centuries.

### 1640: Charles I Seizes Royal Mint
Charles I seizes £200,000 from Royal Mint to finance escalating conflicts with Parliament and Scotland. Destroys confidence in government storage, forcing wealthy Londoners to store bullion with private goldsmiths instead. Accidental catalyst for private banking revolution.

### 1642–1651: English Civil War
Parlamentarians vs. Royalists. War financing needs drive goldsmith innovation. During this period, goldsmiths begin issuing "payable to bearer" receipts rather than to named individuals—creating England's first true private paper money that circulates independently.

### 1640–1672: English Goldsmith Banking
London goldsmiths transform from storage to banking. Issue bearer receipts that circulate as currency. Discover fractional reserve banking, creating money "out of thin air." System works brilliantly until confidence collapses.

### 1666: Great Fire of London (September 2-6)
Inferno destroys Lombard Street's physical infrastructure, including goldsmith establishments. But goldsmiths save their ledgers—records of obligations prove more valuable than buildings. System survives, demonstrating that banking depends on institutional memory, not physical assets. Backwell and others rebuild within five years.

### 1668: Swedish Riksbank Established
World's oldest surviving central bank, founded after Stockholms Banco's collapse from over-issuing banknotes. Placed under parliamentary (Riksdag) control, not royal authority—early model of central bank independence.

### 1672–1674: Third Anglo-Dutch War
Charles II wages war against Dutch Republic. Desperate for funds, facing empty Treasury. War costs drive sovereign default.

### 1672: Stop of the Exchequer (January 2)
Charles II suspends £1.3 million in debt repayments to goldsmith-bankers to finance Third Anglo-Dutch War. Five major banks fail immediately (Backwell, Vyner, three others). Over 10,000 families financially ruined. Proves goldsmith receipts had become true money; demonstrates fatal flaw of unregulated private currency without lender of last resort.

### 1688: Glorious Revolution
William III and Mary II take English throne under strengthened Parliament. Bill of Rights (1689) forbids Crown from suspending laws or levying taxes without parliamentary consent. Sovereignty shifts from monarch to Parliament.

### 1688–1697: Nine Years' War (War of the Grand Alliance)
William III's war against Louis XIV's France. Massive military costs create urgent need for reliable government financing. Britain's war spending drains Treasury, making traditional tax-and-spend impossible. War financing crisis drives creation of Bank of England in 1694—Parliament needs credible way to borrow for military campaigns.

### 1690: Commission of Public Accounts
Parliament creates oversight body and inserts appropriations into supply bills. Government spending becomes accountable to elected representatives, not royal discretion.

### 1694: Bank of England Founded (July 27)
War financing breakthrough: Parliament charters joint-stock Bank to lend £1.2 million to government at 8% for Nine Years' War. Critically, new taxes are earmarked to service debt. Investors confident loans backed by parliamentary taxation, not royal whim. England pioneers modern funded state bond. Bank solves goldsmith catastrophe problems: stable institutional framework, uniform currency, parliamentary backing, crisis liquidity. War drives monetary innovation.

### 1696: Great Recoinage
Parliament appoints Isaac Newton as Master of the Mint. Undertakes massive recoinage to restore debased silver currency.

### 1708: Bank of England Act
Parliament restricts partnerships of more than six persons from issuing banknotes, protecting Bank's monopoly. Unintended consequence: creates legal space for hundreds of small "country banks" to emerge, issuing private currency without authorization.

### 1717: Accidental Gold Standard
Newton sets mint price of gold relative to silver too low for silver's market value. Silver flows out of Britain. Gold becomes de facto anchor of pound. Britain inadvertently creates gold standard that will spread globally.

### 1720: John Law's Mississippi Bubble
Scottish financier John Law's experiment with paper money and central banking in France ends in spectacular collapse. Discredits fiat currency for generations, demonstrating both potential and dangers of unbacked money without institutional discipline.

---

## THE AGE OF GOLD (1797 – 1914)

### 1793–1815: French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars
Britain's 22-year war against revolutionary and Napoleonic France. Largest military mobilization in British history drains Bank of England's gold reserves from £8 million (1791) to £1 million (1797). War spending necessitates suspension of gold convertibility—proving paper money can function without metal backing when institutions are credible. Britain finances entire war on fiat currency.

### 1787: Country Banks Proliferate
Thomas Fox establishes Fox, Fowler & Company in Wellington—one of 700+ private banks that will issue their own currency across England by 1810. These unchartered partnerships create most of Britain's money supply, financing the Industrial Revolution through private note issuance.

### 1789–1797: French Assignats
Revolutionary France prints assignats backed by confiscated church lands. Initial 400 million livres swells to hyperinflation. By 1796 replaced at 30:1 ratio; France reverts to metallic money under Napoleon. Cautionary tale of unbacked paper in wartime.

### 1797: Bank Restriction Act (February 26)
French troops land at Fishguard, Wales—panic triggers bank run. Facing Napoleonic invasion threat and war-depleted reserves, Parliament suspends Bank of England's gold convertibility (announced as "temporary until six weeks after peace"). Notes outstanding (£10.9M) double gold reserves (£5.3M). "Restriction" lasts 24 years through entire Napoleonic Wars, proving paper money can function without metal backing if institutions remain credible. War forces recognition of money's true nature.

### 1802: Henry Thornton's *Paper Credit*
Bank of England director publishes first systematic analysis of monetary policy, demolishing the Real Bills Doctrine by showing interest rates matter more than "real" backing. Anticipates modern central banking theory by over a century.

### 1810: Bullionist Controversy
Parliamentary committee refutes Bank directors' claim that note issuance can't be excessive if backed by "real bills." Report establishes that paper money requires discipline beyond commercial backing—early victory for monetary orthodoxy.

### 1821: Return to Gold
Britain restores gold convertibility at pre-1797 parity. Demonstrates institutional credibility: 24 years of paper currency, then voluntary return to gold at original rate. Total inflation during suspension: only 22.3% over 18 years.

### 1825–1826: Banking Panic
Seventy-one country banks fail (10% of all banks) following Latin American debt defaults. Crisis leads to 1826 reforms allowing joint-stock banks and restricting small notes. Reveals fragility of undercapitalized private banking.

### 1844: Bank Charter Act (Peel's Act)
Parliament prohibits new note-issuing banks and requires 100% gold backing for Bank of England notes above £14 million. Intended to end fractional reserve banking, but Currency School makes fatal error: ignores bank deposits. Private money creation continues invisibly through checking accounts.

### 1861–1865: American Civil War
U.S. government issues "greenbacks"—fiat currency not backed by gold—to finance war. Legal Tender Acts (1862-63) make greenbacks acceptable for all debts except customs duties and interest on government bonds. Demonstrates sovereign money creation in wartime. After war, contentious debate over whether to retire greenbacks and return to gold standard.

### 1866: Overend-Gurney Crisis
Major discount house fails, triggering panic. Bank of England holds discount rate at 10% for 95 days—longest period of high rates after any crisis. Marks Bank's evolution toward modern lender-of-last-resort role.

### 1870–1914: Classical Gold Standard
Major economies peg currencies to specified quantities of gold. Fixed exchange rates internationally. Trade imbalances self-correct via specie flows. Era of relative monetary stability but limited domestic policy flexibility.

### 1890: Baring Crisis
Bank of England orchestrates rescue with £3 million gold loan from Banque de France and £1.5 million from Bank of Russia. Demonstrates international cooperation and lender-of-last-resort function despite minimal reserves (under 5% of liabilities).

### 1907: Panic of 1907 (October)
New York banking crisis triggered by failed speculation. J.P. Morgan personally organizes rescue, but reveals U.S. financial system's vulnerability without central bank. Crisis demonstrates need for lender of last resort. Directly leads to Federal Reserve creation.

### 1913: Federal Reserve Act (December 23)
U.S. creates hybrid public-private central bank after Panic of 1907 exposed system fragility. Enshrines Real Bills Doctrine in law, requiring Fed to discount only "real" commercial paper—a theoretical error that will deepen the Great Depression. Decentralized structure (12 regional banks) reflects American distrust of concentrated financial power.

---

## THE ERA OF UPHEAVAL (1914 – 1971)

### 1914–1918: World War I
European powers suspend gold convertibility to finance war. Germany, France, Austria-Hungary abandon gold payments immediately. Britain maintains gold link but strains under war deficits. War spending dwarfs tax revenue—governments create money through central banks and debt issuance. Inflation follows in most belligerent nations. Gold standard's rigidity incompatible with total war financing needs. War proves fiat currency necessary for modern warfare.

### 1920s: Weakened Gold Returns
Partial return to gold standard, but system undermined by war debts and economic instability.

### 1929–1933: Great Depression
Gold standard rigidity contributes to deflation spiral. Fed raises rates in October 1931 to defend gold, worsening crisis. Nine thousand banks fail (one-third of system). Countries that leave gold earlier recover faster—Britain (1931) sees production above 1929 levels by 1934; France (stays until 1936) remains 26% below. Gold standard transforms recession into depression by preventing monetary response. System's inflexibility catastrophically exposed.

### 1943: Abba Lerner's Functional Finance
Economist articulates principles that government should keep spending at level to buy all producible goods, can create money to meet obligations, and policy should be judged by effects not deficit size. Keynes privately endorses but warns "heaven help anyone who tries to put it across to the plain man."

### 1939–1945: World War II
Global conflict reshapes international monetary order. War financing and post-war reconstruction needs drive Allied powers to design new system. U.S. emerges as dominant creditor nation with world's largest gold reserves. War's end creates opportunity for institutional reset.

### 1944: Bretton Woods Conference (July 1-22)
War-driven monetary redesign: Allied nations meet at Mount Washington Hotel while WWII still rages. Keynes proposes "bancor" supranational currency; U.S. Treasury's Harry Dexter White insists on dollar-based system. July 13: decisive moment when Indian delegation forces definition of "gold-convertible exchange"—U.S. admits it means dollars. System emerges: currencies pegged to dollar (±1%), dollar alone convertible to gold at $35/oz. War creates conditions for dollar's reserve currency status.

### 1946: Beardsley Ruml's "Taxes for Revenue are Obsolete"
Fed Chairman declares that after leaving gold standard, government has "final freedom from the money market" and no longer needs taxes to get money. Articulates functional finance for policy audience, but ideas soon marginalized.

### 1950–1953: Korean War
U.S. military spending surges. War demonstrates Bretton Woods system working under strain—dollar outflows increase but gold convertibility maintained. Post-war reconstruction spending plus military costs begin slow drain on U.S. gold reserves.

### 1950–1958: European Payments Union
OEEC creates multilateral clearing system through BIS in Basel. Transforms bilateral trade gridlock into efficient settlement. "Progressive hardening" requires increasing gold/dollar settlement as deficits grow. Intra-European trade more than doubles; dissolves in 1958 when goal achieved.

### 1958: Full Currency Convertibility
Bretton Woods currencies fully convertible. Dollar becomes reserve currency. International balances settled in dollars, only U.S. owes gold.

### 1961–1968: London Gold Pool
Eight central banks contribute $270 million to stabilize gold price at $35/oz. Initially successful (1962-65 surplus), but loses $3.7 billion (1965-68). France withdraws 1967. March 1968: Emergency closure after losing $3 billion in five months.

### 1955–1975: Vietnam War (U.S. Involvement 1965–1973)
U.S. military spending in Vietnam accelerates dollar creation and outflows. "Guns and butter"—Johnson finances war while expanding Great Society programs without raising taxes. War spending contributes to dollar overhang problem. By 1971, $80 billion in foreign dollar liabilities vs. only $10 billion U.S. gold reserves. War costs make gold convertibility unsustainable. Vietnam demonstrates limits of reserve currency maintaining both domestic spending and gold backing.

### 1965–1967: France Converts Dollars to Gold
Following de Gaulle's February 4, 1965 press conference attacking dollar "exorbitant privilege," France aggressively converts dollars. Between 1962-1966, France reduces dollar reserves by $2.8 billion—most of U.S.'s $3.3 billion gold decline. Vietnam War spending accelerates pressure on U.S. gold reserves.

### 1968: Two-Tier Gold Market
March 17 Washington communiqué creates official tier ($35/oz for central banks only) and private tier (free market). Private market reopens April 1 at $38/oz, peaks at $42.60 in May. System acknowledges gold standard is dying.

### 1971: Nixon Closes Gold Window (August 15)
U.S. gold reserves fallen to ~$10 billion vs. $80 billion foreign dollar liabilities. Britain requests $3 billion transfer August 11. Nixon ends dollar-gold convertibility, calling it "temporary" (it's permanent). Bretton Woods dismantled. By 1973, major currencies float.

### 1971–1978: The 1970s Inflation Crisis
OPEC oil shocks (1973, 1979) quadruple energy prices, creating supply-driven inflation. Global commodity shortages and wage-price spirals follow. Fed Chairman Arthur Burns correctly diagnoses "cost-push" inflation but lacks tools to address supply constraints—raising interest rates can't produce more oil. Inflation reaches 14.8% by March 1980. Crisis demonstrates that inflation stems from real resource bottlenecks, not simply "too much money," and that monetary policy alone cannot solve supply-side problems.

### 1979–1983: Volcker Breaks Inflation Through Recession
Fed Chairman Paul Volcker raises federal funds rate to 20% (June 1981), deliberately engineering worst recession since Great Depression. Unemployment reaches 10.8%. Inflation falls from 14.8% (March 1980) to 3.8% (1983)—not by solving supply constraints but by crushing demand through mass unemployment. Demonstrates that central banks can suppress inflation through sufficient economic pain, establishing "credibility" model that prioritizes price stability over employment. Human cost: years of lost output, destroyed careers, communities never fully recovered.

## THE FIAT ERA (1971 – PRESENT)

### 1971–Present: Pure Fiat Currency
All major economies adopt fiat money—currency backed by government decree, not commodity. Central banks use interest rates, reserve requirements, and open-market operations to target price stability and growth.

### 1980s–1990s: Inflation Targeting
Central banks gain independence and adopt explicit inflation targets. Policy credibility replaces gold as nominal anchor.

### 1993: Warren Mosler's *Soft Currency Economics*
Hedge fund manager independently develops chartalist ideas from monetary operations experience, founding what becomes Modern Monetary Theory. Connects with academic economists to create systematic framework.

### 1997: Asian Financial Crisis
Thailand floats baht July 2; currencies collapse across Asia (Indonesian rupiah -80%, Thai baht -50%). Crisis demonstrates how foreign currency debt creates vulnerabilities distinct from domestic money creation—external constraints bind non-reserve currencies differently.

### 2008: Global Financial Crisis
Shadow banking system (repo markets, asset-backed commercial paper, money market funds) implodes after subprime mortgage defaults. Fed expands balance sheet from $870 billion to $4.5 trillion through quantitative easing. Despite massive monetary expansion, core inflation remains below 2%—demonstrating productive capacity, not money quantity, constrains inflation.

### 2009–2012: Tea Party Movement
Rick Santelli's February 19, 2009 CNBC rant sparks grassroots mobilization around taxpayer identity. April 15 Tax Day rallies in 750+ locations. Movement crystallizes household budget metaphor as mass political force, constraining fiscal policy despite QE demonstrating government's monetary capacity.

### 2014: Werner Experiment & Bank of England Admission
Richard Werner conducts first empirical test of money creation, proving banks create deposits "out of nothing" when lending. Bank of England publishes official confirmation: "loans create deposits"—not the reverse. Vindicates Post-Keynesian theory, refutes money multiplier model taught in textbooks for decades.

### 2019: MMT Enters Public Debate
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez cites MMT for Green New Deal funding. Chicago Booth survey of 42 leading economists shows unanimous rejection of MMT claims. Stephanie Kelton's *The Deficit Myth* (2020) becomes bestseller. Ancient chartalist insights—that taxation drives currency demand, sovereigns can't run out of own money—rediscovered after centuries of suppression.

### 2020–2021: COVID Fiscal Response
Governments deploy unprecedented spending: U.S. passes $5+ trillion in relief. Initially no inflation (supply and demand both collapsed), but by 2021-22 inflation reaches 9.1% as supply chains disrupt and demand surges. Fed raises rates from 0% to 5.25% in 18 months. Inflation falls to ~3% by 2024 without severe recession—demonstrating fiat system's flexibility when institutions respond.

### 2020s: Digital Currency Experiments
Central banks explore CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies). Cryptocurrencies offer decentralized alternatives, but state-backed currencies remain dominant based on taxing power and institutional stability.

## THE THROUGH-LINE

Five thousand years of monetary evolution reveal one constant: money is not a thing but a relationship. From clay tablets to digital ledgers, value lies not in metal but in institutions capable of enforcing obligations. Gold was never the foundation—it was a convenient fiction that delayed our recognition that money has always been credit, always political, always dependent on trust.
