# Comparative Table: Monetary Regimes Across History

---

|---------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Domestic Backing** | Tax authority + accounting infrastructure | Tax-driven paper money + state production | Private bank reputation + convertibility to BoE notes | Gold convertibility + parliamentary credibility | Dollar convertibility + gold backing | Central bank credibility + fiscal capacity |
| **International Backing** | None (purely domestic) | None (purely domestic) | None (domestic only) | Gold specie + institutional reputation | U.S. dollar convertibility to gold | Economic size + institutional stability |
| **Primary Medium** | Clay tablets, tally sticks, grain receipts | Government paper (*jiaozi*) | Private banknotes (700+ issuers) | Gold coins + convertible banknotes | National currencies pegged to dollar | Fiat currency + digital entries |
| **Private Money Creation** | None (state monopoly) | Limited (temple credits) | **Dominant** (60% of money supply by 1810) | **Extensive** (deposit banking post-1844) | Regulated commercial banking | **97% of money** (bank deposits) |
| **Unit of Account** | Grain, silver weight, local denomination | Copper cash, silver tael | Pound sterling | Weight of gold | National currency units | National currency units |
| **Flexibility** | **High** (debt jubilees) | **High** (state control) | **High** (no reserve requirements) | **Low** (convertibility constraint) | **Medium** (adjustable pegs) | **High** (no external constraint) |
| **Discipline Mechanism** | Sovereign discretion | Tax collection + note limits | Market discipline (bank runs) | Automatic gold flows | IMF rules + dollar-gold link | Central bank independence + inflation targets |
| **Crisis Frequency** | Unknown | Periodic inflation crises | **5 panics in 44 years** (1781-1825) | **15 business cycles, 5 banking panics** (1870-1914) | Relatively stable (2 major crises) | **7 recessions in 50 years** (1972-2022) |
| **Inflation Volatility** | Variable | High (hyperinflation episodes) | Moderate | **2x higher than fiat era** | Low-moderate | **1/5 of gold standard** (post-1990s) |
| **War Finance** | Debt cancellation or in-kind extraction | Paper money expansion | Suspension of convertibility | Suspension required (1797, 1914) | Tensions from reserve country deficits | Direct central bank financing possible |
| **Key Vulnerability** | Arbitrary sovereign action | Productive capacity collapse | Undercapitalized banks, no lender of last resort | Deflationary bias; procyclical policy | Reserve currency dilemma (Triffin) | Inflation if institutions weak; political pressure |
| **Example Success** | Mesopotamian temples (millennia); English tallies (700 years) | 1023-1204 (stable paper money) | Financed Industrial Revolution | Britain 1870–1914 (price stability) | 1950s–1960s (stable growth) | Post-1990s inflation targeting (low, stable inflation) |
| **Example Failure** | French royal defaults | 1368+ (excessive issuance, inflation) | Panic of 1825 (71 banks failed) | Great Depression (9,000 bank failures, 25% unemployment) | 1960s–1971 (dollar-gold link broke) | 1970s stagflation; Zimbabwe, Venezuela hyperinflation |
| **Locus of Trust** | Tax collection capacity | State production monopoly + tax acceptance | Bank reputation + BoE convertibility | Precious metal + convertibility institutions | U.S. gold reserves + dollar hegemony | Central bank independence + fiscal credibility |
| **Transition Pressure** | Inability to finance foreign wars | Mongol invasion, fiscal collapse | Banking crises + industrialization needs | War costs exceed gold reserves | U.S. Vietnam War spending + trade deficits | None yet; CBDC and crypto debates |

## **Key Insights from Comparison**

### **1. Domestic vs. International Tension**
Every regime except pure fiat created sharp distinction between domestic and international money. Temple ledgers and tally sticks worked perfectly within realms but failed across borders. Gold standard solved international problem but constrained domestic policy. Bretton Woods tried to split difference with dollar-gold hybrid. Only modern fiat makes same currency work domestically and internationally—but only for countries with sufficient credibility.

### **2. Flexibility-Discipline Trade-off**
Systems cluster by trade-off between flexibility (ability to create money as needed) and discipline (constraints preventing abuse). Temple systems had maximum flexibility but relied on sovereign discretion. Gold standard had maximum discipline but minimum flexibility. Modern fiat has high flexibility; discipline must come from institutional design (central bank independence, inflation targets).

### **3. War as Catalyst**
Major regime transitions driven by war finance needs. Tally system couldn't finance foreign wars → Bank of England (1694). Napoleonic Wars → suspension of gold (1797). WWI → collapse of classical gold standard. WWII → Bretton Woods. Vietnam War → end of Bretton Woods. Each crisis revealed existing regime's vulnerabilities.

### **4. Private Money Creation Is Ancient, Not Modern**
The table reveals private money creation is not a modern innovation but appears across eras. Song Dynasty temple credits, country banks creating 60% of England's money supply (1810), deposit banking post-1844, and modern banks creating 97% of money—all demonstrate that private credit expansion has always coexisted with state money. The key: private money depends on state foundation (tax-driven demand, convertibility to state money, or state guarantee).

### **5. Crisis Frequency Refutes Gold Standard Mythology**
Quantitative data demolishes the claim that gold provided stability. Gold standard era (1870-1914): 15 business cycles, 5 banking panics, inflation volatility 2x higher than modern fiat. Country banking (1781-1825): 5 panics in 44 years. Pure fiat (1972-2022): 7 recessions in 50 years, inflation volatility 1/5 of gold standard (post-1990s). The "discipline" gold provided was procyclical instability, not stability.

### **6. The Persistence of Institutions Over Metal**
Most successful regimes combined credible institutions with appropriate constraints. Britain under gold standard (1821–1914) worked because of Parliament, not because of gold per se. Song Dynasty paper money functioned for centuries with tax acceptance. French absolutism failed under both commodity and paper money because institutions lacked credibility. Modern fiat succeeds where central banks have independence and fiscal authorities maintain discipline; fails where institutions are weak.

### **7. Evolution Toward Explicit Management**
Progression from implicit to explicit institutional management. Temple priests managed credit through ritual. Song Dynasty explicitly linked taxation to money demand. Gold standard automated adjustment through specie flows (but required suspension during crises). Bretton Woods required interstate cooperation. Modern fiat demands transparent central bank policies and fiscal rules. Each step made human discretion more visible—and more accountable.
