# Glossary of Key Terms

This glossary provides quick definitions for technical and historical terms used throughout the book. Terms are organized alphabetically for easy reference.

---

## B

**Bank Charter Act of 1844**: British legislation that divided the Bank of England into two departments (Issue and Banking), mandated that new note issuance be fully backed by gold, and prohibited new banks from issuing notes. Intended to control money creation but failed by not recognizing deposits as money.

**Bank Restriction Period (1797-1821)**: The 24-year period when Britain suspended gold convertibility to finance the Napoleonic Wars. Demonstrated that paper money could function successfully without gold backing when institutions were credible.

**Bimetallism**: Monetary system where both gold and silver serve as legal tender at a government-set exchange ratio. Britain operated on bimetallism before Newton's 1717 adjustment accidentally created a de facto gold standard.

## C

**Chartalism / State Theory of Money**: The view that money derives its value from taxation authority and institutional power, not from commodity backing. Named after the Latin "charta" (token). Argues that governments accepting currency for tax payments creates demand independent of metal content.

**Creditor-Debtor Dynamics**: The systematic wealth transfer that occurs during deflation (benefits creditors) or inflation (benefits debtors). During deflation, fixed debts become harder to repay as money becomes more valuable; during inflation, debts become easier to repay as money becomes less valuable.

## D

**Deposit Creation**: The process by which banks create money by making loans. When a bank approves a loan, it simultaneously creates a deposit in the borrower's account. The loan is an asset (money owed to the bank) and the deposit is a liability (money the bank owes the customer). This creates new purchasing power that didn't exist before.

**Deflation**: A sustained decrease in the general price level. Under deflation, the real burden of debt increases (it takes more goods/labor to repay the same nominal debt), systematically transferring wealth from debtors to creditors.

## F

**Fiat Money**: Currency that derives value from government decree and taxation authority rather than commodity backing. The term comes from Latin "fiat" (let it be done). Modern currencies like the dollar, euro, and yen are fiat money.

**Fractional Reserve Banking**: System where banks hold only a fraction of deposits as reserves while lending out the rest. For example, a bank holding $100 in deposits might keep $10 in reserves and lend $90, creating $190 in total money from $100 in base money.

**Fiscal Capacity**: A government's ability to tax its population and collect revenue. Strong fiscal capacity—backed by effective administration and rule of law—enables governments to create credible currency. Weak fiscal capacity leads to currency instability.

## G

**Gold Points**: The upper and lower limits on exchange rate movements determined by the cost of physically shipping gold between countries. When exchange rates hit these points, arbitrageurs would profit by shipping gold, creating automatic pressure toward equilibrium.

**Gold Standard**: Monetary system where currency is convertible to a fixed amount of gold on demand. Britain operated on a gold standard from 1717 (de facto) or 1821 (de jure) until 1914, and briefly from 1925-1931. The system imposed deflationary bias and transferred wealth from debtors to creditors.

## L

**Lender of Last Resort**: Central bank's function to provide emergency liquidity to financial institutions during crises. Prevents solvent but illiquid banks from failing due to panics. The Bank of England pioneered this role; the Federal Reserve was created in 1913 partly to serve this function.

## M

**Metallism / Commodity Theory**: The view that money must be backed by precious metals (gold or silver) to have value. Argues that money is valuable because of what it *is* (commodity with intrinsic value) rather than the relationship it represents.

**Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)**: Contemporary economic framework arguing that governments that issue their own fiat currency face different constraints than households. Such governments cannot "run out of money" but are constrained by real resources (productive capacity) rather than finance. Inflation, not insolvency, is the risk of excessive spending.

## O

**Output Gap**: The difference between an economy's actual output and its potential output at full employment. When the output gap is large (high unemployment, idle capacity), money creation can mobilize unused resources without causing inflation.

## P

**Productive Capacity**: The maximum amount of goods and services an economy can produce with available resources (workers, factories, materials). The real constraint on money creation—creating money beyond productive capacity causes inflation; creating money to mobilize unused capacity does not.

## Q

**Quantitative Easing (QE)**: Central bank policy of creating money to purchase assets (government bonds, mortgage-backed securities) to inject liquidity into the economy. Used when conventional interest rate policy becomes ineffective (rates near zero). The Federal Reserve used QE extensively during 2008-2014 and 2020-2022.

**Quantity Theory of Money**: The theory that money supply growth directly determines inflation, often expressed as MV = PY (Money × Velocity = Price Level × Output). Assumes velocity is stable and output is fixed at full employment. David Ricardo championed this theory to support gold standard orthodoxy.

## R

**Real Bills Doctrine**: The theory that banks should only lend against "real goods" in production or transit, not for speculation. Argues that such lending is "self-liquidating" and cannot cause inflation. Thoroughly discredited after the Great Depression, when Federal Reserve adherence to this doctrine deepened the crisis.

**Regression Theorem**: Ludwig von Mises's argument that money must trace its value back to an original commodity (typically gold or silver). Claims purely fiat money is logically impossible because people need a reason to initially accept it. Chartalists counter that taxation authority provides this initial acceptance.

## S

**Seigniorage**: The profit government makes from creating money. For example, if it costs $0.05 to produce a $100 bill, seigniorage is $99.95. Historically, monarchs debased coins to increase seigniorage. Modern governments earn seigniorage by creating currency and deposits.

**Shadow Banking**: Financial institutions and instruments that perform bank-like functions (credit creation, maturity transformation) outside traditional banking regulation. Includes money market funds, repo markets, asset-backed commercial paper. The 2008 crisis demonstrated that shadow banking could create systemic risk comparable to traditional banking.

**Specie**: Physical coins made of precious metal (gold or silver). Distinguished from paper currency or electronic money. The term comes from Latin "species" (kind, type).

## T

**Tally Sticks**: Wooden sticks used as receipts for tax payments in medieval England (circa 1100-1826). Split lengthwise with notches indicating amounts—one half (stock) kept by taxpayer, other half (foil) kept by Exchequer. Demonstrated that taxation authority creates currency demand without commodity backing.

**Triffin Dilemma / Triffin's Impossible Position**: The contradiction inherent in a national currency serving as global reserve currency. The country must run persistent deficits to supply reserves to the world, but persistent deficits undermine confidence in the currency. Named for economist Robert Triffin, who predicted in 1960 that this would doom the Bretton Woods system.
