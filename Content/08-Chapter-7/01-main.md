# The First Breaking: 1797-1844

The news reached London on February 25, 1797: French troops had landed at Fishguard, Wales. The invasion force was small—fourteen hundred men, mostly convicts and irregulars—and would be captured within days. But panic spread faster than facts. By dawn on February 26, crowds gathered outside the Bank of England, demanding gold. The Bank's reserves, already depleted by years of war finance, could not withstand a sustained run. That afternoon, the Privy Council met in emergency session. By evening, they had made a decision that would have been unthinkable a generation earlier: **suspend gold convertibility**. The Bank of England, for 103 years the guarantor of sterling's value in metal, would no longer redeem its notes for coin.¹

The suspension was announced as temporary—"until six weeks after the conclusion of peace." It would last **twenty-four years**. During that time, Britain would fight and win the Napoleonic Wars, finance the largest military mobilization in its history, and prove that paper money could function without gold backing—if the institutions behind it were credible enough. The Bank Restriction Act, as it came to be known, was the first successful experiment in **fiat currency** by a major power. It worked not because of gold but despite its absence.²

### The crisis of 1797

The French landing was merely the trigger. The real crisis had been building for years. Britain's war against revolutionary France, begun in 1793, had drained the Bank's gold reserves from **£8 million** in 1791 to less than **£1 million** by February 1797. War spending, poor harvests requiring grain imports, and provincial bank runs had all contributed. By the time panic hit London, the Bank's notes in circulation—**£10,865,050**—were almost exactly **twice** its gold reserves of **£5,322,010**.³

Under normal circumstances, this would not have mattered. Most people preferred the convenience of paper to the weight of metal. But war created abnormal circumstances. Merchants needed gold to pay for foreign supplies. Investors sought safety in tangible assets. And once a run began, it fed on itself: the more people demanded gold, the more others feared the Bank would run out, prompting them to demand gold too.⁴

The Privy Council's decision to suspend convertibility was pragmatic, not principled. The alternative was worse: if the Bank exhausted its reserves, it would fail, taking the entire financial system with it. Better to preserve the institution and hope that confidence in paper could be maintained long enough to win the war and restore gold payments afterward.⁵

What happened next surprised everyone. The Bank's notes did not collapse in value. Prices rose—eventually by about **50 percent** between 1797 and 1801—but this was moderate inflation, not hyperinflation. The pound's exchange rate against foreign currencies fell, but it did not crash. And most remarkably, **people continued to accept Bank notes** for everyday transactions, even knowing they could not be redeemed for gold.⁶

### Why paper held its value

The success of the Bank Restriction Act was not inevitable. France's assignats, issued during the Revolution, had collapsed into worthlessness within five years. The American Continental dollar had suffered the same fate during the Revolutionary War. Why did British paper money succeed where others had failed?⁷

The answer lay in **institutional credibility**. The Bank of England, unlike France's revolutionary government or America's Continental Congress, had a century-long track record of prudent management. It had never defaulted, never hyperinflated, never betrayed the trust placed in it. When convertibility was suspended, the public believed it was temporary—and that belief was rational, based on the Bank's history.⁸

Several factors reinforced confidence:

**1. Merchant support**: On February 28, 1797—the day after suspension—London's leading merchants issued a public statement declaring their willingness to accept Bank notes "as readily as gold." This was not altruism but self-interest: the merchants needed the financial system to function, and that required maintaining confidence in paper.⁹

**2. Credible commitment**: The suspension was framed as temporary, "until six weeks after the conclusion of peace." This gave the public a clear endpoint and a reason to believe that gold convertibility would eventually resume. The government did not claim the power to print money indefinitely; it claimed only the necessity of suspending convertibility during wartime emergency.¹⁰

**3. Fiscal backing**: In 1798, Prime Minister William Pitt introduced Britain's first **income tax**—a direct levy on earnings that demonstrated the government's capacity to raise revenue. This was crucial: foreign creditors and domestic holders of government debt needed assurance that Britain could service its obligations. The income tax provided that assurance, showing that the state had untapped fiscal capacity.¹¹

**4. War success**: Britain ultimately won the Napoleonic Wars, validating the public's confidence. Had Britain lost, the Bank's notes would likely have collapsed. But victory vindicated the suspension, proving that the government's promises—even when not backed by gold—could be trusted.¹²

### The Bullionist Controversy: The beginning of the Great Reversal

Not everyone accepted the suspension quietly. By 1809, with prices rising and the pound's exchange rate falling, a fierce debate erupted over monetary policy. But this was more than a technical dispute about inflation—it was the opening battle in a campaign that would fundamentally transform public understanding of government finance. What began as an argument about Bank of England note issuance would end with the establishment of a new orthodoxy: that governments must tax or borrow before they can spend, that money creation threatens liberty, and that fiscal discipline requires external constraints on state power.¹³

The **Bullionists**, led by economist David Ricardo, argued that the Bank had issued too many notes, causing inflation and currency depreciation. The solution, they insisted, was to restore gold convertibility immediately, forcing the Bank to contract its note issue. But Ricardo's vision went beyond technical monetary management. In his 1824 "Plan for the Establishment of a National Bank," he argued that government should not issue money directly but must borrow from the Bank, paying interest—explicitly establishing the paradigm that **taxes and borrowing must fund spending**. This was a radical departure from the understanding that had prevailed when the Bank was founded in 1694, when Paterson had openly described the Bank's power to create money "out of nothing."¹³ᵃ

The **Anti-Bullionists**, including the Bank's directors and government officials, blamed external factors: poor harvests, food imports, and subsidies to continental allies. They argued that the Bank had merely accommodated the "needs of trade" by discounting legitimate commercial paper. According to the **Real Bills Doctrine**, as long as the Bank lent only against good collateral, its note issue could not cause inflation—it would simply follow the economy's real demand for money.¹⁴

In June 1810, a Parliamentary Select Committee chaired by Francis Horner issued the **Bullion Report**, siding decisively with the Bullionists. The Report blamed the Bank for not contracting note issue and rejected the Real Bills Doctrine as "wholly erroneous in principle, and pregnant with dangerous consequences in practice." It recommended restoring convertibility within two years.¹⁵

Parliament rejected the Report's recommendations by large majorities. The war was not yet won; the government needed continued access to Bank credit; and most MPs feared that a sudden contraction would cause economic hardship. The debate raged on, but policy remained unchanged—for now.¹⁶

But the Bullionists had planted a seed that would grow into the dominant economic orthodoxy of the 19th century. Their victory would come not in 1810 but in 1821, when gold convertibility was restored, and definitively in 1844, when the Bank Charter Act institutionalized their principles into law.¹⁶ᵃ

### Henry Thornton's genius

Amid the controversy, one voice stood out for its analytical clarity: **Henry Thornton**, a banker and MP who in 1802 had published *An Inquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain*. Thornton's book is arguably the most important work of monetary economics before the 20th century, anticipating insights that would not be formalized for another hundred years.¹⁷

Thornton's key contributions:

**The two-interest-rate model**: Thornton distinguished between the Bank's lending rate and the "current rate of mercantile profit." If the Bank's rate was too low relative to profit opportunities, borrowing would expand indefinitely, driving inflation. This was the foundation for all subsequent theories of the "natural rate" of interest, including Knut Wicksell's cumulative process (1898).¹⁸

**Lender of last resort**: Thornton argued that the Bank should hold large reserves and lend freely during financial panics ("internal drains"), but distinguish between temporary liquidity crises and permanent external drains that required gold outflows. This doctrine, later refined by Walter Bagehot, became the cornerstone of central banking practice.¹⁹

**Discretionary policy**: Thornton advocated flexible monetary management, recognizing that rigid rules could not account for changing circumstances. But by 1810, observing the Bank's behavior during the Restriction, he concluded that discretion needed legal constraints—the Bank could not be trusted to manage itself without external discipline.²⁰

**On deflation**: Thornton warned that "a very great and sudden reduction in the accustomed number of bank notes" would create "unusual and temporary distress" and "discouragement of the fabrication of manufactures." He understood what later economists would call the **sticky wages** problem: prices and wages do not adjust instantly to monetary contraction, so deflation causes real economic pain.²¹

**On government spending and money creation**: Thornton recognized that government spending created money directly. Francis Horner, summarizing Thornton's work, noted that "loans to Government, in their direct operation, rather contributed to repair" money shortages "because notes were issued from Exchequer almost immediately into market." This anticipated the modern understanding that government deficit spending increases the money supply—an insight that would be forgotten and rediscovered repeatedly over the next two centuries.²¹ᵃ

Thornton's work was largely ignored by his contemporaries, who preferred simpler theories. But his insights would prove prophetic when Britain finally restored gold convertibility in 1821.

### The seductive fallacy: Real Bills and its consequences

The **Real Bills Doctrine** deserves attention not as an obscure historical curiosity but because this seemingly logical theory would contribute directly to the Great Depression. Understanding why intelligent people believed it—and why it was catastrophically wrong—helps explain how monetary policy disasters happen.

The doctrine was perhaps the most dangerous economic fallacy in history, surviving for 150 years despite repeated refutations.

The doctrine originated with Adam Smith's *Wealth of Nations* (1776): banks should lend only against legitimate commercial bills backed by goods in production. Smith argued the money supply would automatically adjust to the "needs of trade" and could never cause inflation—like a self-regulating pond where outflows equaled inflows.²²

The logic seemed airtight. A merchant borrows to buy inventory. When goods sell, the loan is repaid. Money creation tied to real production, with automatic limitation. What could go wrong?

**Everything**, as Thornton demonstrated in 1802. The fatal flaw: real bills are **nominal** instruments. A bill for $1,000 of wheat at $10 per bushel represents 100 bushels. If prices double, the same 100 bushels generate a bill for $2,000. The "real bills" backing expands with the price level—providing **no constraint** on monetary expansion. It creates a positive feedback loop: more money → higher prices → larger nominal value of bills → more money creation. The doctrine promised automatic limitation but delivered unlimited expansion.²³

Thornton identified a second flaw: the doctrine ignored **interest rates**. If the Bank's lending rate remained at 5 percent while profit expectations rose to 7 percent, borrowing demand would become unlimited. Merchants would borrow not for commerce but to profit from the spread. The doctrine promised automatic limitation but delivered perpetual inflation.²⁴

The 1810 **Bullion Report** condemned the doctrine as "wholly erroneous in principle, and pregnant with dangerous consequences in practice."²⁵ Yet it survived, enshrined in the **Federal Reserve Act of 1913**: Federal Reserve Banks could discount only "notes arising out of **actual commercial transactions**"—self-liquidating paper excluding anything "speculative."²⁶

The disaster came in 1929-1933. As the Depression deepened, the Fed reasoned that stock market speculation was "speculative, not productive," and therefore should not be supported. As production fell, the "needs of trade" legitimately declined, so monetary contraction was the appropriate response. This **procyclical** policy (policy that amplifies economic cycles rather than dampening them) deepened the Depression catastrophically. Nearly 9,000 banks failed. The money stock contracted by one-third. Friedman and Schwartz later demonstrated that this monetary contraction **caused** the Great Depression—not the 1929 crash but the policy choice that followed.²⁷⁻²⁸

In 2002, Federal Reserve Governor Ben Bernanke offered an extraordinary apology at a conference honoring Milton Friedman's 90th birthday: "Regarding the Great Depression. You're right, we did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again."

The Real Bills Doctrine's appeal lay in its apparent common sense: tie money creation to real production, and inflation becomes impossible. But money is a nominal measure that interacts with the price level. The doctrine confused nominal and real values, ignored interest rates, and prescribed procyclical policy that amplified economic fluctuations. Those consequences would not be fully understood for another 130 years, when they helped destroy the world economy.²⁹

### The return to gold

The Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815 with Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo. But the Bank Restriction continued for six more years, as Parliament debated how and when to restore convertibility. The **Peel's Act** of 1819 set a phased schedule: resumption in gold ingots (not coin) beginning May 1, 1821, with full coin redemption deferred until 1823.²²

The Bank, eager to demonstrate its soundness, began voluntary partial resumption in January 1817. By May 1821—two years ahead of the legal deadline—full convertibility was restored. The pound was back on gold at its pre-1797 parity: **£3 17s 10½d per ounce** of standard gold.²³

The economic consequences were severe. To restore the pound's value, the Bank had to contract its note issue dramatically. Note circulation fell from **£28.4 million** in 1814 (backed by only **£2.2 million** in gold) to **£2.3 million** in 1821 (backed by **£11.2 million** in gold). The ratio had completely reversed.²⁴ In contemporary terms, the 1814 note circulation represented approximately **9.5% of British GDP**, while gold reserves were only **0.7%**—a note-to-gold ratio of 12.9:1. By 1821, note circulation had contracted to just **0.6% of GDP** while gold reserves rose to **3.0%**—a staggering **92% reduction** in circulating money over seven years.²⁴ᵃ

Prices collapsed. The general price index fell from **150** at the end of 1818 to **120** by early 1821 and **104** by mid-1824. Farmers, who had borrowed during the inflationary war years, found themselves repaying loans in appreciated currency—their debts had effectively increased in real terms. Industrial unemployment spiked, especially in Birmingham's metal-working trades. Contemporary Thomas Attwood declared that Peel's Act had created "more misery, more poverty, more discord, more of everything that was calamitous to the nation, except death, than Attila caused in the Roman Empire."²⁵

The human cost was staggering. Wheat prices had averaged 108 shillings per quarter in 1813; by 1822 they had collapsed to 45 shillings—a 60 percent drop.²⁵ᵃ A farmer who borrowed £500 during the war years to expand his acreage faced a debt burden that had effectively doubled in real terms. His income had been cut in half, yet his obligations remained fixed. In February 1822, MP John Gooch reported to Parliament that petitions from Suffolk showed "one unusual scene of distress" among farmers.²⁵ᵇ David Ricardo, writing from Paris in December 1821, observed that "the farmers—theirs is a pitiable situation" with no relief except "the liberality of their landlords" who were themselves "in a state of suffering."²⁵ᶜ

The London Gazette's insolvency lists tell the story in names: John Griffin, "formerly of Ogbourn St. George, farmer" in Wiltshire; John Wiltshire of Warboys, "farmer and labourer" in Huntingdonshire.²⁵ᵈ These were men who had done nothing wrong—had worked harder than ever—but monetary policy had made their debts unpayable. William Cobbett, touring southern England in late 1822, found farmers who had bought lambs for 24 shillings each and sold them two years later for 8 shillings—losses of £120 plus interest on borrowed capital.²⁵ᵉ Many tenant farmers lost their land; laborers turned to poor relief as wages fell. By May 1822, MP Matthias Attwood warned that without relief, "a great portion of the land at present under cultivation must of necessity be abandoned" with "the destruction of the farmers and labourers."²⁵ᶠ

The policy had been designed to restore Britain's "honour"—to prove that the pound's value was as solid as gold. But honour was an abstraction. For the farmers named in insolvency proceedings and the thousands more who suffered in silence, the policy was a disaster that destroyed livelihoods and families. The gold standard had been restored, but at a human cost that economists measuring price indices could not capture.

Even David Ricardo, the leading advocate of resumption, criticized the Bank for contracting too rapidly. "The evils of the time," he wrote, "arose from the Bank's not having followed his advice" for gradual reduction. The deflation was unnecessary—a policy choice, not an economic necessity.²⁶

Yet despite the short-term pain, resumption succeeded. Britain remained on the gold standard until 1914, making sterling the world's reserve currency for a century. The "honour of the country and stability of its institutions" had been restored, in the words of economic historian Frank Fetter. The gold standard had survived its first great test.²⁷

### Why the transformation happened: Creditor class interests and the manufacture of orthodoxy

The return to gold in 1821 was not merely a technical monetary decision—it was the culmination of a deliberate campaign to transform public understanding of government finance. Between 1800 and 1850, earlier conceptions of money creation as a governance tool were systematically replaced by the doctrine that taxes must fund government spending. This was not the discovery of economic truth. It was manufactured consensus serving specific class interests.²⁷ᵃ

The transformation served Britain's **creditor class**—bondholders, merchants, industrialists, and bankers who dominated 19th-century commercial society. After the Napoleonic Wars, Britain's National Debt had grown from £12 million in 1700 to **£850 million** by 1815—a seventy-fold increase. Historian Martin Daunton notes: "After the victory at Waterloo in 1815, consent was lost as a result of the high level of debt service which fell on producers within an unreformed political system." The creditor class, holding these bonds, needed "sound money" to protect their real returns. Inflation from paper money would erode the value of their holdings. Deflation—which the return to gold at the old parity guaranteed—would increase the real value of what they were owed.²⁷ᵇ

The creditors were not likely to support default or inflation given their own reliance on credit. They had a general concern to maintain the sanctity of credit, fearing that a loss of income might lead bondholders to default on their own obligations. The solution was establishing fiscal orthodoxy that claimed to protect taxpayers from government profligacy—while actually protecting creditors' returns. As one contemporary assessment stated: "Parliamentary control of finances works only if the government is not in a position to provide for unauthorized expenditures by increasing the circulating amount of fiat money."²⁷ᶜ

Ricardo and the Currency School provided intellectual justification. Ricardo's **Quantity Theory** established that excess money issue causes inflation—a technical truth weaponized to serve creditor interests. **Say's Law** ("supply creates its own demand") eliminated justification for expansionary money creation during depressions. Ricardo's zero-sum growth theory suggested government money creation merely redistributed rather than created value. These weren't neutral discoveries—they were actively constructed to support specific policy conclusions.²⁷ᵈ

The **Bank Charter Act of 1844** institutionalized this new orthodoxy into law. It established 100% gold backing requirements for new Bank of England note issues and gave the Bank monopoly on note issuance. This made gold constraint automatic, removing discretion from government. Money creation must be constrained by gold reserves, not government needs. The principle that had been explicit in 1694—that the Bank created money "out of nothing"—became unthinkable in respectable economics.²⁷ᵉ

When dissenters emerged, they were systematically marginalized. **Thomas Attwood and the Birmingham School** argued that Britain should have a paper currency not tied to gold and that government should counter depressions by increasing the money supply—proto-Keynesian insights that included formulations of the multiplier effect. Yet Attwood was dismissed as suffering from "financial monomania." Birmingham School economists were called "currency cranks" and "crude inflationists." Despite presenting a petition with 40,000 signatures in 1829, the Duke of Wellington's government refused to consider Attwood's proposal. His 1839 Chartist petition with 1,280,958 signatures was rejected by 235 votes to 46.²⁷ᶠ

Modern assessment recognizes "the theories of the Birmingham School are now recognized as embryonic versions of the Keynesian economics of the 1930s." But in their time, maintaining fiscal orthodoxy was more important than economic accuracy. As Ludwig von Mises later summarized the ideology: "Sound money meant a metallic standard... devised as an instrument for the protection of civil liberties against despotic inroads on the part of governments." The rhetoric was about liberty. The reality was about protecting creditor wealth.²⁷ᵍ

### Peel's unintended consequence: The birth of modern banking

The Bank Charter Act of 1844 represents one of history's great unintended consequences. Robert Peel and the Currency School economists crafted legislation to end fractional reserve banking and establish 100% gold backing for new note issuance. They succeeded in destroying private note issuance. They utterly failed to control credit creation. The Act **prohibited new banks from issuing notes** anywhere in Britain, froze existing country banks' issuance at 1844 levels, and mandated that banks would **lose note-issuing rights upon merger**. Combined with the requirement that new Bank of England notes be backed 100% by gold (above a £14 million fiduciary issue), Peel believed he had ended monetary inflation caused by excessive bank credit.²⁷ʰ

The mechanism worked through economic attrition rather than direct prohibition. In 1844, **277 country banks issued £8.6 million in notes** compared to £21 million from the Bank of England. Unable to expand note circulation as the economy grew, note issuance became increasingly unprofitable for country banks. When banks merged—and industrialization accelerated merger activity—note privileges lapsed and transferred to the Bank of England. By 1880, only 157 banks issued notes worth barely £6 million. By 1914, just 11 banks issued £401,719. **Fox, Fowler and Company issued the last private English banknote in 1921**, completing a 77-year transition to Bank of England monopoly.²⁷ⁱ

But the Currency School made what critics would call a "tragic error": they assumed bank deposits weren't money. They focused obsessively on paper notes while ignoring checking accounts and deposit transfers. The Act "only stopped the creation of paper bank notes—it didn't refer to other substitutes for money, such as bank deposits." Banks immediately pivoted. As monetary historian Charles Goodhart writes, "Both the Bank of England and the country banks, deprived of the right to issue notes at will, began to issue deposits to a fare-thee-well." **Fractional reserve banking didn't end in England after 1844; it simply changed to focusing on demand deposits instead of notes**.²⁷ʲ

### The intellectual blind spot: Why economists couldn't see deposits

The Currency School's error wasn't mere oversight—it reflected a profound intellectual blind spot that extended to the most brilliant economists of the Victorian era. Even those who understood banking intimately failed to grasp that deposit creation was functionally identical to note issuance. This wasn't ignorance but conceptual blindness: the inability to see that accounting entries could create money just as effectively as printing presses.

**John Stuart Mill**, writing in 1848, came tantalizingly close to the truth. In his *Principles of Political Economy*, Mill acknowledged that bank deposits operated "exactly parallel in every respect to bank notes"—he saw the similarity clearly. Yet he explicitly denied that credit could "make something out of nothing." When a bank makes a £1,000 loan by creating a £1,000 deposit, Mill argued, it hasn't created new purchasing power—it has merely redistributed existing wealth. This was precisely wrong. The loan literally creates a new deposit where none existed before. The borrower spends the £1,000, the recipient deposits it in another bank, and total deposits in the system have increased by £1,000. New money has appeared through bookkeeping alone.²⁷ᵖ

**Walter Bagehot** presents an even more striking case. His 1873 masterwork *Lombard Street* remains a classic analysis of Victorian banking, still read today for its insights into financial panic and crisis management. Bagehot understood deposit banking's practical operations better than perhaps anyone of his generation—he described how banks mobilized savings, how credit moved through the economy, how panics spread through interconnected institutions. Yet according to modern reviewers of his work, Bagehot "would reject the idea that banks create money. Banks cannot create money. They accept deposits, and then they can loan out some portion of those deposits." The man who wrote the definitive guide to deposit banking fundamentally misunderstood the core mechanism: banks don't lend out deposits, they create deposits by lending.²⁷ᵍ

The error persisted because it seemed intuitively correct. From any individual bank's perspective, it looks like intermediation: Customer A deposits £100, the bank lends £80 to Customer B, keeping £20 as reserves. But zoom out to the banking system as a whole, and the picture inverts: Customer B's loan creates a new £80 deposit somewhere in the system. Then someone deposits that £80, enabling another £64 loan, which creates another deposit, and so on. The system-level reality—money creation through lending—was invisible to observers focused on individual bank operations.²⁷ᵍᵃ

Not until **Keynes's *Treatise on Money* (1930)** do we find explicit recognition of what was actually happening. Keynes wrote: "It is evident that there is no limit to the amount of bank money which the banks can safely create provided that they move forward in step." Banks create deposits by buying assets or making loans. The money doesn't exist before the loan—the loan creates it. Yet even Keynes retreated from this clarity. His 1936 *General Theory*, the work that reshaped economics, adopted a more ambiguous treatment of money and banking. The brief moment of clarity in the *Treatise* gave way to formulations that could be interpreted as traditional intermediation. The confusion would persist for another half-century.²⁷ʳ

The full articulation awaited the Post-Keynesian revival of the 1970s-1980s. **Basil Moore's 1988 book** *Horizontalists and Verticalists* systematically explained the mechanism: "loans create deposits"—the reverse of the textbook sequence. Banks accommodate creditworthy demand for loans. When they lend, they create deposits. Central banks then supply whatever reserves banks need to settle payments between each other, setting the interest rate rather than controlling the quantity. Money supply is endogenous—determined by loan demand, not by central bank policy or reserve constraints. Moore was building on earlier Post-Keynesian work by Nicholas Kaldor and Hyman Minsky, but his 1988 synthesis finally made the argument comprehensive and irrefutable.²⁷ˢ

Why did it take so long? **The intellectual investment in the wrong model was enormous**. The "loanable funds" theory—banks as intermediaries between savers and borrowers—anchored entire edifices of economic theory. Interest rates were supposed to equilibrate saving and investment. Central banks were supposed to control money supply through reserve requirements. The money multiplier provided neat mathematical exercises for undergraduate textbooks. Admitting that banks create money by lending would require rebuilding monetary economics from the foundation.²⁷ᵗ

More profoundly, **deposit creation was invisible**. When a country bank printed a £5 note and handed it to a borrower, everyone could see new money entering circulation—a physical object that hadn't existed before now passed from hand to hand. But when a bank creates a £5 deposit by writing "+£5" in a ledger next to a customer's name, nothing physical changes. The money exists only as an accounting entry, a promise to pay on demand. Victorian economists could see notes and gold—tangible objects that seemed to obey physical laws of conservation. They couldn't see ledger entries the same way, couldn't grasp that accounting could create purchasing power as effectively as minting coins.²⁷ᵘ

This wasn't mere academic confusion—it was **the greatest regulatory failure in banking history**. Because Currency School economists didn't understand that deposits functioned identically to notes, they regulated the visible (notes) while ignoring the invisible (deposits). The 1844 Bank Charter Act meticulously controlled paper currency—100% gold backing for new Bank of England notes, frozen limits for country banks, lapsed privileges upon merger. Meanwhile, deposit banking operated completely unconstrained. No reserve requirements (until much later), no capital requirements, no limits on deposit creation. Banks simply shifted from issuing notes to creating deposits, continuing fractional reserve money creation through a new medium.²⁷ᵛ

Banks exploited this regulatory blind spot for seven decades. As note issuance became unprofitable and restricted, banks pivoted to deposits. The Scottish banks provide a telling example: after the 1845 Bank Notes (Scotland) Act capped their note circulation, they "shifted to deposits" to maintain profitability. English joint-stock banks, barred from London note issuance, built their business models around deposit creation from the start. By 1900, deposits utterly dominated the money supply—99.91% of transactions by value. The mechanism that country banks had used with notes—lending creates money, constrained only by confidence and redemption demands—simply moved underground into deposit banking, where it operated with even less oversight than note issuance had faced.²⁷ʷ

The irony compounds: while Currency School doctrine demanded 100% gold backing for notes to prevent inflation, banks were creating deposits worth many times their gold reserves—the precise "overissue" the Act was designed to prevent, just in accounting form rather than printed paper. Peel had won the battle (note control) while losing the war (credit control). The Currency School's intellectual triumph enabled the

 expansion they feared, simply by failing to recognize that the enemy had changed uniforms.²⁷ˣ

Credit creation continued unabated, now in forms the Act didn't regulate. The transformation was dramatic. In 1844, bank notes dominated the money supply. By the twentieth century, bank deposits constituted **99.91% of transactions by value**, with cash representing just 0.09%. Peel had banned visible private money while accidentally authorizing invisible private money creation on an unprecedented scale. The same mechanism that had allowed country banks to issue notes against fractional reserves now allowed all banks to create deposits through lending—but without the regulatory constraints the Act had imposed on notes.²⁷ᵏ

The United States followed a parallel trajectory. The National Banking Acts (1863-1864) imposed a **10% tax on state bank notes**, making their issuance uneconomical. State bank note circulation "fell from $143 million in 1865 to $4 million by 1867"—effectively eliminated through punitive taxation rather than direct ban. But state banks discovered the same workaround as English banks: deposits. "By the 1880s, deposit accounts had changed the primary source of revenue for many banks," and "by the 1890s, **90% of the money supply was in checking accounts**." Individual deposits grew from 5% to 23% of GDP between 1863 and 1913, with deposits rising from 96% to 592% of bank capital. State banking made a dramatic comeback through deposit creation, which faced no equivalent tax.²⁷ˡ

What emerged on both sides of the Atlantic was the modern two-tier monetary system: **central bank base money (reserves and currency) at the foundation, with commercial banks creating deposit money on top**. The Bank of England and later the Federal Reserve (1913) provided reserves—the settlement medium banks needed to clear payments with each other. Commercial banks created deposits through lending, multiplying the money supply far beyond the base. The hierarchy that had existed informally when country banks pyramided notes on Bank of England reserves was now formalized: banks needed central bank reserves for settlement, but they created most circulating money through deposit expansion.²⁷ᵐ

The Currency School's failure to understand this mechanism reveals a profound truth about money: **the form matters less than the function**. Whether money circulates as paper notes or electronic deposits, the mechanism is the same—banks create purchasing power by lending, constrained not by reserves but by demand for credit and confidence in the banking system. Peel's Act tried to control money by controlling its physical form. But money is not a thing; it is a relationship, a ledger entry, a promise. Changing the medium from notes to deposits didn't eliminate private money creation—it merely made it invisible, operating through accounting entries rather than printed paper.²⁷ⁿ

The irony is complete: the Act designed to establish state control over money creation instead **perfected private money creation** by driving it underground into deposit banking, where it would operate with even less oversight for the next century. The principle that William Paterson had articulated in 1694—that the Bank "hath benefit of interest on all moneys which it creates out of nothing"—remained true. Only now, hundreds of commercial banks were creating money out of nothing through deposit expansion, and the Currency School's legislative triumph had made this process less visible and less regulated than the note issuance it replaced.²⁷ᵒ

The transformation was complete. Within 50 years of Adam Smith's explicit statement that princes could give value to paper money through taxation, such ideas had become nearly unspeakable. The gold standard's success—its century of apparent stability from 1821 to 1914—would cement this false narrative so deeply that even its collapse in the 20th century would not fully dislodge it. The household budget metaphor, the idea that governments must "find the money" before they can spend, would persist long after the gold that supposedly justified it had disappeared from the monetary system.²⁷ʰ

### The Scottish exception: When private banking worked best

Yet amid these regulatory failures and intellectual blind spots, one region demonstrated that competitive private banking could operate with remarkable stability. **Scotland's "free banking" era (1716-1845)** remains the strongest historical example advocates cite when arguing private money doesn't need state foundation. The system endured for **129 years**, weathered multiple English banking crises with minimal disruption, and operated without a central bank monopoly, reserve requirements, or deposit insurance. If any historical case proves private money can work independently of state control, this would be it.

The system's origins were straightforward. Three chartered banks—the **Bank of Scotland** (1695), **Royal Bank of Scotland** (1727), and **British Linen Company** (1746)—dominated initially, but smaller provincial banks emerged throughout the 18th century. By 1845, nineteen banks with 363 branches operated across Scotland. Unlike England, where the 1708 Act prohibited joint-stock banking within 65 miles of London, Scottish banks could be partnerships with unlimited liability—every partner's personal wealth stood behind the bank's promises. This created powerful incentives for prudent management.²⁷ʸ

What made the system distinctive was **competitive note issuance**. Each bank printed its own banknotes, and customers could choose which bank's notes to accept. Banks met weekly for **note exchanges**—presenting each other's notes for redemption in specie—creating immediate market discipline against overissue. If Bank A printed too many notes relative to its gold reserves, competing banks would accumulate Bank A's notes and demand redemption, draining its specie. This "adverse clearing" mechanism supposedly prevented the overexpansion that plagued English country banks. Modern free banking advocates point to this as proof that competitive discipline can substitute for central bank regulation.²⁷ᶻ

The empirical record seems impressive. Scottish banking failures were remarkably rare compared to England's frequent banking panics. When England suffered the 1825-26 crisis that destroyed 71 country banks (10% of the total), Scotland experienced only three failures with limited systemic impact. The 1857 Panic that devastated English banking barely touched Scotland. Adam Smith famously praised Scottish banking in *The Wealth of Nations*, noting that despite extensive note issuance, "The business of the country is almost entirely carried on by means of the paper of those different banking companies, with which purchases and payments of all kinds are commonly made. **Silver very seldom appears except in the change of a twenty shillings bank note, and gold still seldomer**."²⁸⁰

Yet this seemingly stateless success story dissolves upon closer examination. Scottish "free" banking operated entirely **within British state frameworks**—parliamentary charters, national legal systems, and access to Bank of England facilities. The system wasn't independent of the state; it was a **state-sanctioned competitive arrangement** operating under British sovereignty.

First, **all Scottish banks required parliamentary charter or operated under British common law**. The Bank of Scotland received a charter from the Scottish Parliament in 1695—explicit state authorization. After the 1707 Act of Union merged Scottish and English parliaments, the Royal Bank of Scotland (1727) received Westminster charter, as did the British Linen Company (1746). Provincial banks operated as partnerships under British banking law, subject to the same legal frameworks as English banks—contract enforcement, property rights, bankruptcy proceedings all required state institutions.²⁸¹

Second, Scottish banks **settled ultimately in Bank of England notes and gold**—not some private commodity money independent of state systems. As the Bank of England established dominance, Scottish banks increasingly held Bank of England notes as reserves rather than purely specie. The hierarchy that existed in England—country banks depending on Bank of England notes—replicated in Scotland, just with more competitive note issuance at the second tier. Historian S.G. Checkland documents that Scottish banks held "reserves in Bank of England notes and London bills" by the mid-19th century, making them dependent on the English central banking system.²⁸²

Third, **Parliamentary regulation constrained Scottish banking**, even if less restrictively than in England. The 1765 prohibition of the "option clause" (which allowed banks to suspend redemption) was imposed by Westminster. The 1845 Bank Notes (Scotland) Act—passed by the British Parliament—capped existing banks' note issuance at 1845 levels and prohibited new banks from issuing notes. This wasn't market evolution but regulatory intervention, and notably **existing Scottish banks supported the Act** because it cartelized the market and protected incumbents from new competition. Banker James Gilbart candidly admitted: "Our rights are acknowledged—our privileges extended—and we are saved from conflicts with reckless competitors."²⁸³

The **Ayr Bank failure (1772)** reveals what happened when the system was tested. Douglas, Heron & Company, commonly called the Ayr Bank, was Scotland's largest bank, with £1.3 million in liabilities when it collapsed in June 1772. The causes were standard banking disasters: reckless lending, over-issuance of notes, speculative investments, and fraud. The bank's aggressive expansion—it operated for only three years before collapse—destabilized the entire Scottish system. Panic spread, causing runs even on sound banks. Several smaller banks failed in the cascading crisis.²⁸⁴

What prevented catastrophic systemic collapse? **State-enforced unlimited liability**. The Ayr Bank's partners were personally liable for all debts. They issued a £500,000 bond secured by £3 million in heritable estates to pay noteholders. The legal proceedings took 20-60 years to wind up as estates were liquidated and creditors paid. This wasn't market discipline—it was state-provided legal enforcement of liability through courts, bankruptcy law, and property seizures. Without British legal institutions to enforce claims and liquidate estates, noteholders would have received nothing.²⁸⁵

Even Scotland's famous stability depended on **access to Bank of England as informal lender of last resort**. During crises, Scottish banks could obtain liquidity through London correspondent banks with access to Bank of England facilities. Historian Lawrence White, a free banking advocate, acknowledges this: "Scottish banks' London correspondents had access to the Bank of England's discount window." The system worked better than England's because Scottish banks had stronger incentives (unlimited liability) and better structure (branch banking for diversification), but ultimate stability rested on connection to English central banking.²⁸⁶

The system's end confirms it wasn't purely market-driven. The 1845 Bank Notes (Scotland) Act didn't respond to market failure—Scottish banking was functioning well. Instead, **political economy** drove the change. English banking interests wanted uniformity and protection from competition. The Currency School's ideology demanded note control. Existing Scottish banks accepted the cartelization because it protected profits. The Act prohibited new note-issuing banks, capped existing circulation, and gradually brought Scotland into the Bank of England orbit. By 1914, Scottish note issuance was a vestigial privilege maintained more from tradition than economic necessity, with deposits dominating the money supply.²⁸⁷

What does Scotland actually prove? **Not that private money can exist independently of the state, but that competitive private banking can work well within state-created frameworks**. Scottish banks operated under British sovereignty, parliamentary charters, common law, and court enforcement. They settled in Bank of England notes. They had access to lender of last resort through London correspondents. When crisis came (Ayr Bank), state-enforced liability protected noteholders. The system was "free" in the sense of competitive—not free of state foundation.

The lesson is subtle but crucial: **private innovation and public foundation are complements, not substitutes**. Scotland's 129 years of successful competitive banking required the British state's legal institutions, monetary framework, and crisis backstops. It was "free banking within a state-structured arena," not banking free of the state. Modern advocates who cite Scotland as proof that cryptocurrency or private money can work without state involvement fundamentally misread the history. Even the best-functioning private banking system in history depended entirely on state-created institutions—it just had better competitive structures than England's more monopolistic arrangements.²⁸⁸

### Colonial proof: Taxation drives money through force

While 19th-century orthodoxy denied that taxation drives currency adoption, colonial administrators demonstrated this principle empirically through systematic coercion. The historical record provides the clearest evidence for the chartalist principle—precisely because colonial powers couldn't rely on market mechanisms and had to use force.²⁷ⁱ

**British colonial hut taxes** were explicitly designed to force currency adoption. The Natal Colony's 1849 hut tax eventually contributed 75% of all revenues. By the 1890s-1910s, Kenya, Uganda, Rhodesia, Gambia, Nyasaland, and Mashonaland had all implemented hut or poll taxes **payable only in colonial currency**. As documented in the Rhodesian Study Circle records: "It was variously payable in money, labour, grain or stock and benefited the colonial authorities in four related ways: it raised money; **it supported the currency; it broadened the cash economy, aiding further development; and it forced Africans to labour in the colonial economy**."²⁷ʲ

Historian Martin Daunton writes: **"Could revenue rise sufficiently unless Africans were forced into a commercialized and monetized economy that produced taxable goods and incomes to meet tax liabilities? And could crops be grown for the market, or mines developed, unless a waged labour force was created? Such considerations led to an increased reliance on the hut tax as a means of forcing economic and social change."**²⁷ᵏ

The mechanism was explicit: "Households which had survived on, and stored their wealth in cattle ranching now sent members to work for the colonialists in order to raise cash with which to pay the tax." The Hut Tax (1901) and Poll Tax (1910) in Kenya **"forced Africans into wage labor, as they needed cash to pay these levies."** This was not market-driven currency adoption—it was coercion documented in administrative records.²⁷ˡ

French colonial administrators were equally candid. Scholar Ndongo Samba Sylla documents: "African people had for a long time **resisted the imposition of the French currency**... They were aware that **the acceptance of the colonial currency would disrupt their trade and more importantly would make them economically subordinated to the diktats of their colonial masters**... **As the ban on the import of cowries and the obligation to pay taxes in the colonial currency were not always effective, colonial administrators were often obliged to use legal sanctions and physical force.**"²⁷ᵐ

The widespread resistance—the Hut Tax War (Sierra Leone, 1898), Bambatha Rebellion (South Africa, 1905), First Chimurenga (Rhodesia, 1896-97), Mau Mau Uprising (Kenya, 1952)—demonstrates these taxes' coercive nature. Currency adoption was imposed, not voluntary market-driven evolution. Lord Lugard's Political Memoranda acknowledged taxation was "a means of **educating the Africans into Anglo-Saxon virtues and economic values**"—revealing that colonial powers fully understood taxation's role in forcing currency adoption and economic transformation.²⁷ⁿ

The colonial evidence is damning. At the very moment that respectable economics in London denied that taxation drives currency demand, British administrators in Africa were proving the principle through force. The disconnect reveals the ideological nature of 19th-century monetary orthodoxy: it was not based on empirical observation but on protecting creditor interests and maintaining fiscal discipline that served the wealthy.²⁷ᵒ

The 1821 deflation had caused unnecessary suffering, destroyed livelihoods, and demonstrated that returning to gold at the old parity imposed arbitrary costs on debtors. Yet this lesson would be forgotten. A century later, Britain would repeat this mistake with even more devastating consequences—when Winston Churchill's 1925 return to gold at an overvalued parity would trigger mass unemployment, a general strike, and contribute to the global catastrophe that followed.

### **Chapter Summary**

The Bank Restriction Act of 1797 suspended gold convertibility for 24 years, proving paper money could function without metal backing if institutions were credible. Britain won the Napoleonic Wars using fiat currency, but the 1821 return to gold at pre-war parity caused devastating deflation: note circulation contracted 92%, wheat prices fell 58%, farmers faced insolvency. The Bullionist Controversy established new orthodoxy that taxes must fund spending—a radical departure from 1694 understanding. Henry Thornton's 1802 work anticipated modern monetary theory but was ignored. The Real Bills Doctrine, despite being "wholly erroneous," survived 150 years and contributed to the Great Depression. The Bank Charter Act of 1844 tried to end fractional reserve banking by controlling note issuance but failed because Currency School economists didn't understand that bank deposits function identically to notes—banks simply shifted from creating notes to creating deposits. The transformation was complete: within 50 years of Adam Smith's statement that taxation gives value to paper money, such ideas became unthinkable. Creditor class interests manufactured orthodoxy protecting their wealth through deflation. Scottish "free banking" (1716-1845) proved competitive private banking works well within state frameworks, not independently of them. Colonial hut taxes empirically demonstrated taxation drives currency adoption through force, even as London economists denied the principle. The first breaking revealed that gold was constraint, not foundation—but the lesson would be forgotten and relearned repeatedly.
