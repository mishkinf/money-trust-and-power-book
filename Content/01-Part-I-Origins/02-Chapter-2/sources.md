# Chapter 2 Sources & Summary

## **Chapter Summary**

Medieval merchants created international credit networks that operated independently of metal currency. Bills of exchange—four-party instruments that circumvented usury prohibitions—allowed merchants to settle debts across borders through offsetting obligations rather than shipping gold. Double-entry bookkeeping, systematized by Luca Pacioli in 1494, transformed accounting into a moral and mathematical discipline. Merchant banking families like the Medici built empires on reputation and information networks, not commodity reserves. Clearing systems in Antwerp and Amsterdam demonstrated that most transactions could settle through ledger entries, with metal moving only at the margins. Yet these merchant networks ultimately depended on sovereign currencies backed by taxation authority—bills were denominated in florins, ducats, and pounds, each deriving value from a ruler's power to demand them in tax payments. This merchant-created system proved that credit could function internationally when backed by reputation and institutional trust—a lesson that would shape the development of central banking and modern finance.
