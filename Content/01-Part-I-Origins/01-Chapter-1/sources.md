# Chapter 1 Sources & Summary

## **Chapter Summary**

Money began not as commodity but as credit—recorded obligations managed by central institutions. From Mesopotamian temple ledgers to Chinese paper notes to English tally sticks, societies created money through accounting systems backed by taxation authority. Credit preceded coin by millennia. The medium mattered less than the institutional capacity to impose and enforce obligations. This pattern—credit instruments circulating domestically based on tax authority—worked within sovereign borders but failed across them, setting up the fiscal crisis that would drive the creation of central banks.
