# PART I: THE ORIGINS OF CREDIT MONEY

## The Foundation of Trust

Money did not begin with coins or precious metals. It began with promises—recorded obligations managed by institutions powerful enough to enforce them. From the clay tablets of Mesopotamian temples to the bills of exchange circulating through medieval Europe, credit preceded commodity by millennia. The medium mattered less than the institutional capacity to impose and enforce obligations.

This Part traces money's origins from sacred accounting to international merchant networks, revealing a fundamental truth: money has always been a relationship, not a thing. Temples created credit by recording debts and demanding repayment. Merchants extended this logic across borders through reputation and double-entry bookkeeping. But both systems faced the same limitation: credit instruments worked within zones of trust but failed beyond them.

These early systems reveal a pattern that repeats throughout history: **monetary arrangements are never neutral**. They distribute power, determine who can accumulate wealth, and shape whose interests prevail when systems fail. Temple credits in ancient Mesopotamia concentrated power in religious institutions. Medieval bills of exchange privileged merchants with established reputations over newcomers. Royal borrowing created asymmetries between monarchs who could print domestic credit and foreign creditors who demanded metal. Understanding whose interests each system served—and whose it harmed—is essential for understanding how money works.

The three chapters establish the conceptual foundation:

**Chapter 1** examines credit money in ancient civilizations—sophisticated accounting systems backed by institutional authority, not primitive barter.

**Chapter 2** shows medieval merchants creating international credit networks independent of metal currency.

**Chapter 3** reveals the fiscal crisis driving central bank creation—monarchs could create domestic credit but needed gold for foreign wars.

By Part I's end, the essential problem is clear: credit works when backed by institutional authority, but that authority stops at borders.
