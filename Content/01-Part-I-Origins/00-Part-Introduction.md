# PART I: THE ORIGINS OF CREDIT MONEY

## The Foundation of Trust

Money did not begin with coins or precious metals. It began with promises—recorded obligations managed by institutions powerful enough to enforce them. From the clay tablets of Mesopotamian temples to the bills of exchange circulating through medieval Europe, credit preceded commodity by millennia. The medium mattered less than the institutional capacity to impose and enforce obligations.

This Part traces money's origins from sacred accounting to international merchant networks, revealing a fundamental truth: money has always been a relationship, not a thing. Temples created credit by recording debts and demanding repayment. Merchants extended this logic across borders through reputation and double-entry bookkeeping. But both systems faced the same limitation: credit instruments worked within zones of trust but failed beyond them.

These early systems reveal a pattern that repeats throughout history: **monetary arrangements are never neutral**. They distribute power, determine who can accumulate wealth, and shape whose interests prevail when systems fail. Temple credits in ancient Mesopotamia concentrated power in religious institutions. Medieval bills of exchange privileged merchants with established reputations over newcomers. Royal borrowing created asymmetries between monarchs who could print domestic credit and foreign creditors who demanded metal. Understanding whose interests each system served—and whose it harmed—is essential for understanding how money works.

The three chapters that follow establish the conceptual foundation for everything that comes after:

**Chapter 1** examines how credit money emerged in ancient civilizations—not as a primitive stage before "real" money but as a sophisticated system of accounting backed by institutional authority. The unit of account preceded the physical medium by thousands of years.

**Chapter 2** shows how medieval merchants created international credit networks that operated independently of metal currency. Bills of exchange and clearing systems demonstrated that most transactions could settle through ledger entries, with metal moving only at the margins.

**Chapter 3** reveals the fiscal crisis that would drive the creation of central banks: monarchs could create credit domestically through instruments like tally sticks, but foreign wars required gold or silver that only creditors could provide. The asymmetry between domestic and international credit would shape monetary institutions for centuries.

By the end of Part I, the essential problem is clear: credit works when backed by institutional authority, but that authority stops at borders. The solution—a bank that could create money with the full backing of the state's fiscal power—would emerge from constitutional revolution in 1688 and institutional innovation in 1694.
