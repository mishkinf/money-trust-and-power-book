# Chapter 3 Sources & Summary

## **Chapter Summary**

Early modern monarchs faced an impossible dilemma: war required credit, but credit required trust, and royal defaults had destroyed that trust. Domestic instruments like tally sticks worked within borders because tax authority backed them, but foreign wars required gold or silver that monarchs didn't have. Repeated defaults—from Edward III to Charles II's Stop of the Exchequer—made royal borrowing ruinously expensive. The solution emerged not from economics but from constitutional revolution: parliamentary control of taxation after 1688 made England's debt credible for the first time. Lenders could trust Parliament's legal commitment even if they distrusted the king. This institutional innovation—separating borrowing authority from repayment authority—solved the credibility problem that had plagued European monarchies for centuries.
