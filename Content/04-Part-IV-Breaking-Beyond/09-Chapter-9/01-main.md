# PART IV: THE BREAKING AND BEYOND

## Chapter 9: The Interwar Catastrophe

**Chapter Premise:** Churchill's 1925 return to gold at an overvalued parity triggered deflation and the General Strike, while gold hoarding by France and the US created the Great Depression. Roosevelt's 1933 break from gold proved fiat money works when institutions are credible.

### The Eurozone's Interwar Replay

In 2015, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras faced an impossible choice. The European Central Bank demanded austerity: cut pensions by 40%, slash public sector wages, raise taxes on a collapsing economy. Greek GDP had already fallen 25%—a depression worse than America's in the 1930s. Youth unemployment exceeded 50%. Families were losing homes, pensioners couldn't afford medicine, young people were fleeing the country. The troika's prescription was clear: more deflation, more unemployment, more suffering.

Tsipras had campaigned on ending austerity. Greek voters had rejected the bailout terms in a referendum. But Greece couldn't print euros—it had surrendered monetary sovereignty when it joined the eurozone. The choice was stark: accept the troika's demands or exit the euro, triggering financial chaos. In July 2015, Tsipras capitulated. Greece would endure more austerity to stay in the currency union.

This wasn't a new dilemma. It was Churchill's 1925 choice replayed with modern instruments. Churchill returned Britain to gold at an overvalued parity, imposing deflation on coal miners to maintain the pound's prestige. Tsipras kept Greece in the euro at an overvalued exchange rate, imposing depression on Greek workers to maintain eurozone membership. Both prioritized currency credibility over human welfare. Both proved that monetary unions without fiscal flexibility redistribute wealth from workers to creditors through unemployment and wage cuts.

Understanding the interwar catastrophe illuminates why the eurozone crisis was inevitable—and why similar crises will recur until the fundamental design flaw is fixed. The gold standard failed because it prioritized metal over people. The euro struggles because it prioritizes currency stability over employment. The lesson of the 1930s remains urgent: monetary constraints are political choices, not economic laws. And those choices have human costs that economists measuring GDP cannot capture.

**This chapter examines how Churchill's 1925 return to gold at an overvalued parity imposed 10% deflation on British workers, triggering the General Strike and seventeen months of miner suffering.** We'll trace how France and the US hoarded gold (creating the Great Depression), document the human cost through stories like Harry Todd's coal mining family and Iowa farmer foreclosures, and reveal France's five-year agony from staying on gold until 1936. The chapter demonstrates that Roosevelt's 1933 break from gold—nationalizing gold, devaluing the dollar, abrogating gold clauses—proved fiat money works when institutions are credible, with GDP growing 8% annually afterward. The lesson: countries that left gold earlier recovered faster, proving gold caused economic damage rather than preventing it.

Winston Churchill stood at the dispatch box in the House of Commons on April 28, 1925, announcing Britain's return to the gold standard. The pound would once again be convertible at its pre-war parity: **$4.86 per ounce of gold**. Members cheered. The City celebrated. Britain had restored its honor, proving that the disruptions of the Great War were temporary aberrations. The pound would be "as good as gold" once more—a phrase that carried the weight of empire and the promise of stability.¹

What Churchill did not say—perhaps did not fully understand—was that the market exchange rate stood at **$4.77**. The official parity represented a **10 percent overvaluation**. British exports would become 10 percent more expensive overnight. To maintain the parity, British wages and prices would have to fall by 10 percent—a massive deflationary adjustment imposed on an economy still recovering from war. John Maynard Keynes, watching from Cambridge, understood immediately what Churchill had done. Within three months, he would publish a scathing pamphlet: *The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill*. Every prediction would come true.²

A century after Britain's first return to gold in 1821—which had caused devastating deflation and farmer insolvencies—the country was about to repeat the mistake. The gold standard that had seemed eternal before 1914 had already cracked during the Great War. The interwar attempt to restore it would fail catastrophically. By 1971, the last link between major currencies and precious metal would be severed—not through careful planning but through crisis and necessity. The final breaking would reveal what the first had hinted: gold had never been the foundation of monetary value. Trust was. And Churchill's decision would destroy that trust for millions of British workers.³

### Churchill's blunder

The problem was deceptively simple. The market exchange rate in January 1925 had been **$4.77**. The official parity of **$4.86** represented approximately **10 percent overvaluation**. British exports would be 10 percent more expensive to foreign buyers; British imports would be 10 percent cheaper. To restore competitiveness, British wages and prices would have to fall by 10 percent—a massive deflationary adjustment that would take years and destroy livelihoods.⁴

**Churchill knew the risks.** He had become Chancellor of the Exchequer in November 1924 with little understanding of monetary economics, but he was smart enough to recognize danger when experts disagreed. On March 17, 1925, he convened a dinner at 11 Downing Street to debate the gold standard decision. On one side sat Otto Niemeyer and John Bradbury from the Treasury, arguing for return to gold at the pre-war parity. On the other, John Maynard Keynes and Reginald McKenna, the former Chancellor, warned bluntly that the decision would cause "unemployment and downward adjustment" of all wages and prices. Churchill's private secretary Percy Grigg recalled the tension—two sides of Britain's establishment arguing over the fate of millions of workers.²⁹

Five days earlier, Churchill had written a revealing minute to Niemeyer: "The Treasury have never, it seems to me, faced the profound significance of what Mr. Keynes calls 'the paradox of unemployment amidst dearth.' The Governor shows himself perfectly happy in the spectacle of Britain possessing the finest credit in the world simultaneously with a million and a quarter unemployed." **Churchill understood.** He saw the contradiction: financial orthodoxy demanded gold, but gold meant unemployment. Yet on April 28, 1925, he announced in his first budget that Britain would return to the gold standard at $4.86—the rate Isaac Newton had set in 1717. The establishment celebrated. The City of London rejoiced. But Churchill had chosen financial prestige over workers' livelihoods.²⁹ᵃ

John Maynard Keynes immediately recognized the catastrophe ahead. The *Times* rejected his response as too controversial, so he published three articles in the *Evening Standard* (July 22-24, 1925) that became his famous pamphlet *The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill*. The title echoed his 1919 work predicting disaster from Versailles Treaty reparations—and like that earlier warning, this one would prove devastatingly accurate.³⁰

Keynes's analysis cut through the technical jargon to show what the 10 percent overvaluation actually meant: **"The policy of improving the foreign-exchange value of sterling up to its pre-war value in gold from being about 10 per cent below it, means that, whenever we sell anything abroad, either the foreign buyer has to pay 10 per cent more in his money or we have to accept 10 per cent less in our money."** British export industries—coal, textiles, steel, shipbuilding—would have to cut prices 10 percent to remain competitive. But they couldn't cut prices unless wages and all domestic costs fell 10 percent simultaneously.³⁰ᵃ

"Thus Mr. Churchill's policy of improving the exchange by 10 per cent was, sooner or later, a policy of reducing every one's wages by 2s. in the £," Keynes wrote. "**He who wills the end wills the means. What now faces the Government is the ticklish task of carrying out their own dangerous and unnecessary decision.**" The phrase was brutal in its clarity: Churchill had willed the 10 percent overvaluation, therefore he had willed the wage cuts that must follow. There was no escape through clever policy or good intentions. The arithmetic was inexorable.³⁰ᵇ

Keynes savaged the ideology behind the decision: "The gold standard, with its dependence on pure chance, its faith in 'automatic adjustments,' and its general regardlessness of social detail, is an essential emblem and idol of those who sit in the top tier of the machine. I think that they are immensely rash in their regardlessness, in their vague optimism and comfortable belief that nothing really serious ever happens." He asked the central question: "Why did he do such a silly thing?" His answer cut deep: Churchill lacked "instinctive judgement to prevent him from making mistakes," was "deafened by the clamorous voices of conventional finance," and was "gravely misled by his experts."³⁰ᶜ

Keynes's specific predictions:
- 10 percent reduction in export receipts
- Transfer of **£1 billion** from productive workers to rentiers (bondholders)
- Increased real burden of the National Debt by **£750 million**
- Deflation, unemployment, and social unrest
- Coal industry crisis within months
- Industrial action as workers resist wage cuts³⁰ᵈ

Every prediction came true. The coal industry, heavily dependent on exports, was hit first. Coal miners faced wage cuts; when they refused, mine owners locked them out. By July 1925, every British coalfield was losing money—Durham alone posted losses of £336,000 in just five months. The dispute escalated into the **General Strike of 1926**—the largest industrial action in British history, with approximately **1.5-1.75 million workers** striking (roughly **7-8% of the British workforce**) in support of **1.2 million locked-out coal miners**. For nine days in May 1926, Britain experienced class conflict unprecedented in its history. Then the Trades Union Congress capitulated, abandoning the miners to fight on alone.³¹

The miners' suffering would continue for months, as families across Durham, South Wales, Scotland, and Lancashire endured what one family would later describe as worse than World War II rationing. The overvalued pound drained gold reserves, forcing the Bank of England to maintain tight monetary policy even as unemployment devastated working-class communities. Unemployment remained high throughout 1925-1931, concentrated in the export industries that Churchill's decision had made uncompetitive.³²

On September 21, 1931, Britain was forced off gold again. The experiment had lasted six years and accomplished nothing except economic hardship. Churchill later called it "the biggest blunder of my life." He should have either returned at a lower parity reflecting wartime inflation, or waited until prices adjusted naturally. Instead, he chose prestige over pragmatism—and Britain paid the price. The human cost of that choice would become clear in the stories of families like the Todds.³³

### Harry Todd's seventeen months

Harry Todd, coal miner at Boldon Colliery in County Durham, was at home when news arrived that the mine owners demanded a 13 percent wage cut plus an extra hour per day. It was April 1926, eleven months after Churchill's announcement. The owners claimed they had no choice—British coal was uncompetitive against German and Polish exports. The overvalued pound had made that inevitable. Durham's coalfields had posted losses of £336,000 in just five months. Someone had to pay for Churchill's decision to restore the pound's prestige. The miners refused. On April 30, the lockout began.³³

Harry lived at 21 Rosebery Terrace, Station Road, Boldon Colliery, with his wife Edith and their children—Vera, nine years old, and Tom, six. Edith was pregnant with their third child. When the lockout began, their household income stopped. No wages. No savings left from previous periods of unemployment. The 1921 Census had already listed Harry as unemployed; mining work was never stable. But this was different. This was an entire industry held hostage to monetary policy.³⁴

The Todd family's survival strategies reveal what Churchill's 10 percent overvaluation meant in human terms. Harry maintained an allotment where he grew vegetables—potatoes, carrots, turnips, whatever would grow in Durham's soil. The family kept hens for eggs, killing chickens only for special occasions. As weeks became months and the strike dragged on, Harry taught Tom and Vera to snare birds on the fell—rabbits when lucky, more often sparrows and thrushes. Edith made broth from chicken bones stretched with barley and vegetables, a pot that lasted for days. When shoes wore out, Harry's brother Loftus, a cobbler, taught the family shoe repair. Eventually they made makeshift shoes from hessian coal bags—the rough fabric that normally carried coal now protecting children's feet from Durham's stones.³⁵

On February 12, 1926, three months into the lockout, Edith gave birth to their third son, Henry Urwin Todd. A child born into a mining family on strike, in the middle of winter, in a house without adequate food or heating. **This was the human cost of the 10 percent overvaluation Churchill had chosen.** The Todds took fierce pride in never requiring Poor Law relief assistance. They survived through their own resourcefulness and the community infrastructure of solidarity—Durham County Council supplied free school meals costing £250,000. The Co-operative Society gave 10-shilling vouchers on credit that miners would have to repay from future wages. A soup kitchen operated at the Wesleyan Chapel, staffed by volunteers using donated provisions including sheep heads—the cheapest protein available. But for families with newborns like the Todds, vouchers and soup kitchens barely kept children alive.³⁶

The Trades Union Congress called a General Strike in solidarity with the miners on May 3, 1926. What followed was nine days of class conflict on a scale Britain had never experienced. Over **1.5-1.75 million workers** walked off their jobs—roughly 7-8 percent of the British workforce—in support of 1.2 million locked-out coal miners. Transport workers refused to drive buses or trains. Printers walked out of newspapers including the *Daily Mail*, whose presses fell silent after compositors refused to print an editorial calling the strike "revolutionary." Dockers left ships unloaded. Ironworkers, builders, and chemical workers joined. In mining regions from Durham to South Wales to Lancashire to Scotland, entire communities mobilized in support.³⁷

The government declared a state of emergency and mobilized for confrontation. Middle-class volunteers drove buses and trains, often with police or military escorts. Troops protected food convoys. The *British Gazette*, a government propaganda sheet edited by Churchill himself, attacked strikers as threatening constitutional order. Churchill wanted to use military force more aggressively; Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin restrained him. The establishment closed ranks: strikers were portrayed not as workers resisting wage cuts caused by monetary policy but as revolutionaries threatening civilization itself.³⁷ᵃ

For those nine days, Britain stood on the edge. Then on May 12, the TUC leadership capitulated, calling off the general strike without winning concessions. They cited fears of violence, concerns about legality, pressure from moderate leaders who feared revolution. **They abandoned the miners.** The coal miners—whose wage cuts had triggered the solidarity action—were left to fight on alone. At Boldon and across Durham, South Wales, Lancashire, and Scotland, mining families watched their supposed allies return to work while they continued suffering. Seven more months. Through summer, through autumn, through the beginning of winter. Without wages. Without prospects. With only community solidarity and increasingly exhausted reserves standing between them and complete destitution.³⁷ᵇ

In November 1926, with seventeen months without wages, the miners were "finally starved into submission and forced to accept the owners' terms." Harry Todd returned to work. His new wage: seven shillings per day—35 pence in decimal currency. This was down from ten shillings before the strike, and far below the £6 per week miners had earned in 1919. Seven shillings for working in coal faces as low as 2 feet 6 inches high, in extreme heat and dust, with ventilation so poor that men worked in loincloths. He would spend the rest of his working life earning less, knowing the wage cut had nothing to do with productivity or market conditions or mine owners' greed. It was the arithmetic of Churchill's April 28, 1925 decision—British coal had to be 10 percent cheaper to compete with German exports, and since coal couldn't be made lighter or transported faster, wages had to fall.³⁸

The Todd family survived. Vera and Tom grew up. Henry survived infancy despite being born during the strike. But decades later, family members would recall a devastating detail: **the family ate better under World War II rationing—with German U-boats sinking supply ships, with the entire nation mobilized for total war—than they had under the supposed peace and prosperity of the 1920s monetary orthodoxy.** This was not hyperbole or false memory. It was the truth of what the gold standard cost. When the government finally understood that money was a tool for mobilizing real resources rather than a commodity to be hoarded, British families could eat. Under the gold standard's discipline, with Churchill's prestige politics determining wages, they starved.³⁹

**This wasn't fate. This wasn't market forces. This wasn't an inevitable price of competing in global coal markets.** This was Churchill's choice to value the pound's exchange rate at $4.86 instead of the market rate of $4.77. That 10 percent difference meant seventeen months without wages for Harry Todd. It meant baby Henry born into destitution. It meant children taught to snare birds for food and make shoes from coal sacks. It meant a lifetime of wages 30 percent below 1919 levels. And it meant that when historians later calculated that "real wages rose" during the 1920s because prices fell faster than nominal wages, the Todds and millions like them experienced that statistical prosperity as grinding poverty punctuated by near-starvation.⁴⁰

### The gold sinks

Britain's mistake was compounded by a global catastrophe: the **maldistribution of gold** in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Two countries—France and the United States—accumulated vast gold reserves while the rest of the world starved for liquidity. The result was the Great Depression.³³

France's share of world gold reserves rose from **7 percent** in 1926 to **27 percent** by 1932. By the Depression's depth, France held nearly as much gold as the United States, despite having an economy one-quarter the size. The causes were multiple: an undervalued franc (from the 1926 Poincaré stabilization), legal requirements that the Bank of France convert foreign exchange into gold, and a mandated **35 percent minimum gold cover ratio** that the Bank exceeded, reaching **80 percent** by 1932.³⁴

The United States contributed to the problem by **sterilizing gold inflows**—preventing incoming gold from creating new money—between 1928 and 1930. When gold flowed into America, the Federal Reserve should have allowed the money supply to expand, raising prices and wages. Instead, it prevented monetary expansion, hoarding the gold while the rest of the world deflated.³⁵

Economist Douglas Irwin quantified the disaster. Between 1927 and 1932:

- World gold stock grew **24 percent**
- U.S. share increased **1 percent**
- France's share increased **24 percent**
- Rest of world: **0 percent**³⁶

By 1932, the U.S. and France held over **60 percent** of the world's monetary gold. Keynes called France a "gold sink." The phrase was apt: gold flowed in but did not circulate, trapped by legal requirements and central bank policy.³⁷

The impact on prices was devastating. Wholesale prices fell **34 percent** between 1928 and 1932. Irwin's analysis shows that U.S. and French gold hoarding explains approximately **40 percent** of this deflation. The gold standard, designed to provide stability, had become an engine of destruction.³⁸

Contemporary economists warned of the danger. Gustav Cassel, Keynes, and Allyn Young all predicted catastrophe if gold hoarding continued. They were ignored. Central bankers, trained to worship gold, could not imagine that their devotion to the metal was strangling the world economy.³⁹

### The arithmetic of ruin

**A note on sources and methodology:** The story that follows comes from agricultural economist William G. Murray's 1933 study "An Analysis of Farm Mortgages and Land Values in Story County, Iowa." Murray documented actual foreclosure cases from courthouse records, anonymizing farmers' names while preserving every financial transaction—purchase prices, mortgage amounts, interest rates, dates of default, foreclosure proceedings. I use his designation "Farmer A" to maintain that anonymity while presenting the documented facts. This is not a composite or hypothetical example; every number comes from legal records. The case matters precisely because it represents thousands of similar tragedies playing out across Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, and the agricultural heartland during 1920-1933. Farmer A's anonymity makes him representative, not fictional.⁴⁰ᵃ

In March 1920, Farmer A made what seemed like a prudent decision. He had farmed 311 acres since at least 1909, carrying a conservative $11,000 mortgage. He was an established, careful operator. When an adjacent 240 acres came available at $396 per acre, he saw an opportunity to expand. Corn prices stood at $2.00 per bushel—double their pre-war level. The calculation seemed sound.⁴¹

He put down $50,000 cash—over 50 percent of the purchase price, far exceeding normal lending standards. He financed the remaining $45,000 with a mortgage on the new land. To fund the expansion, he also increased the mortgage on his home farm from $11,000 to $45,000, borrowing an additional $34,000. He used another $16,000 from deposits and bank loans for livestock and equipment. Total debt: $90,000 on 551 acres. Debt-to-value ratio: 40 percent. By every conventional measure, this was conservative borrowing.⁴²

Then prices collapsed. By December 1921, corn sold for $0.41 per bushel—a 79.5 percent decline in eighteen months. It would never recover to $1.00 during the 1920s, averaging just $0.63 per bushel from 1921 to 1925. The Federal Reserve's devotion to the gold standard, combined with France's hoarding, had triggered worldwide deflation. Agricultural commodities, traded globally, fell furthest and fastest.⁴³

**The mathematics of debt deflation are simple and devastating.** When Farmer A borrowed $90,000 in March 1920, corn at $2.00 per bushel meant he needed to produce and sell approximately 45,000 bushels over time to repay the debt—a manageable sum spread across two farms over several years. By 1921, corn at $0.41 per bushel meant the same $90,000 debt required selling 219,512 bushels—nearly five times as much corn to repay the same dollar amount. His real debt burden had quintupled in commodity terms.⁴⁴

The interest payment alone—$5,000 annually at roughly 5.5 percent—exceeded the entire market value of the corn both farms produced in 1921. He was underwater from day one of the crisis. But like millions of American farmers, he kept trying. From 1921 to 1927, he borrowed from "banks, relatives, any other sources available" to make interest payments. Each year he hoped corn prices would recover above $1.00 per bushel. That hope never materialized. By 1927-1928, having exhausted every source of credit, he lost both farms to foreclosure.⁴⁵

Total wealth destroyed: 551 acres he had worked for years, built up with conservative borrowing, lost to price deflation he could neither predict nor prevent. The story repeated across the American agricultural heartland. Farm mortgage debt had tripled nationally from 1910 to 1920—from $3.2 billion to $9.6 billion—as farmers expanded during the war boom. The foreclosure rate, just 3.2 per 1,000 farms from 1913 to 1920, jumped to 17.4 per 1,000 by 1926 and reached 38.8 per 1,000 by 1933. Over 200,000 farms were foreclosed in 1933 alone.⁴⁶

This was the other face of the gold standard's deflation—not wage cuts and lockouts like Harry Todd endured, but debt slavery followed by dispossession. Fixed nominal debt against collapsing commodity prices. Conservative borrowing made worthless by monetary policy that prioritized gold hoarding over price stability. And just as Churchill's decision destroyed British coal miners' lives for exchange rate prestige, the Federal Reserve's adherence to gold standard orthodoxy destroyed American farmers for the sake of convertibility that existed only on paper—since private citizens couldn't redeem dollars for gold anyway.⁴⁷

**But there's a more direct causal link between Farmer A's ruin and gold standard policy.** The price collapse that destroyed him wasn't accidental or inevitable—it was the predictable result of specific Federal Reserve and Bank of France decisions about gold management. Understanding this mechanism shows how monetary policy transmitted from central banks in Washington and Paris to an Iowa farm's foreclosure in 1928.

The Federal Reserve's gold sterilization policy ran from 1928 to 1930. When gold flowed into the United States—as it did massively during these years, with U.S. gold stock rising from $4.1 billion (1927) to $4.5 billion (1930)—normal gold standard rules required the Fed to allow that gold to create new money. More gold meant more currency, higher prices, and wages rising to absorb the gold inflow. But the Fed, fearing speculation in the stock market, deliberately prevented this. It sterilized gold inflows by offsetting them with open market sales of government securities. Gold came in; the Fed prevented money creation; prices stayed flat or fell.⁴⁷ᵃ

The Bank of France did worse. France's share of world gold reserves exploded from 7 percent (1926) to 27 percent (1932). French law required the Bank to convert foreign exchange (British pounds, U.S. dollars) into gold, then mandated a minimum 35 percent gold cover ratio for franc notes in circulation. The Bank of France exceeded this minimum dramatically, reaching 80 percent coverage by 1932. This meant that for every 100 francs of gold France accumulated, only 125 francs of new currency could be created—and in practice, the Bank created even less. Gold poured into the Bank of France's vaults and died there, withdrawn from the world money supply.⁴⁷ᵇ

The economic mechanism was straightforward: with less money chasing the same goods, prices fell. Douglas Irwin's econometric analysis quantifies this precisely—U.S. and French gold hoarding explains approximately 40 percent of the 1928-1932 deflation. Wholesale prices fell 34 percent globally during these years; 13-14 percentage points of that decline came directly from gold sterilization and hoarding by two central banks. For agricultural commodities traded on world markets—corn, wheat, cotton—the effect was even more severe because these products couldn't adjust supply quickly and had no pricing power.⁴⁷ᶜ

**Now return to Farmer A's arithmetic.** In March 1920, when he borrowed $90,000, global monetary conditions were loose—post-WWI inflation still elevated prices. But by 1921-1928, as the Fed and Bank of France progressively tightened their grip on gold without allowing corresponding money creation, global deflation accelerated. Corn prices didn't fall from $2.00 to $0.41 because of Iowa weather or local oversupply. They fell because central bank policy had reduced the world money supply relative to goods available. Farmer A grew the same corn, but there were fewer dollars globally to buy it.⁴⁷ᵈ

The Federal Reserve could have allowed the incoming gold to create money, which would have raised U.S. prices and made Farmer A's debt burden manageable. The Bank of France could have created more francs backed by its massive gold hoard, which would have increased French demand for imports including American agricultural products. Either action would have arrested deflation. Both central banks had the power to prevent Farmer A's foreclosure through monetary expansion. They chose not to. They chose gold standard orthodoxy—the belief that gold inflows should be sterilized to prevent "inflation," even when the real problem was deflation—over economic stability.⁴⁷ᵉ

By the time the Federal Reserve realized its error and began allowing monetary expansion in 1932-1933, Farmer A had already lost everything. The Bank of France didn't reverse course until 1936, remaining on gold three years after the U.S. abandoned the standard. These weren't natural disasters or inevitable market corrections. They were policy choices made in Washington and Paris that destroyed lives in Iowa. The connection between gold sterilization and farm foreclosures was as direct as the connection between Churchill's $4.86 decision and Harry Todd's snared birds—different mechanisms, same fundamental problem: monetary orthodoxy prioritized over human welfare.⁴⁷ᶠ

### France's five-year agony

Britain left gold in September 1931 and began recovering immediately. The United States followed in March 1933, triggering rapid GDP growth. France, the other gold sink alongside America, stayed on the gold standard until September 1936—five years longer than Britain, three years longer than the United States. Those extra years cost France its industrial base and condemned a generation to unemployment that would last until Nazi occupation made the question academic.⁴⁸

The numbers tell the story. French industrial production fell 25 percent from 1929 to 1935—steeper than Britain's decline, sustained far longer. Official unemployment reached 500,000 by 1935, but the real figure approached 1.5 million when disguised unemployment and underemployment were counted. France had accumulated 27 percent of the world's monetary gold by 1932—nearly as much as the United States despite having an economy one-quarter the size. That gold sat in Bank of France vaults, legally mandated to back currency at rates exceeding requirements, while the French economy contracted for lack of money.⁴⁹

Morvan Lebesque, recalling the winter of 1932-33, wrote of "the winter I spent on the streets...young men trying not to die." Paris soup kitchens served thousands daily. Unemployed workers occupied factories in 1936, demanding work or relief. The political crisis that brought Léon Blum's Popular Front to power in June 1936 forced the question: maintain gold parity or save the Republic? On September 25, 1936, France finally devalued. Too late. The brief recovery that followed barely lifted production above 1929 levels before recession struck again in 1937-38. France never recovered its pre-Depression prosperity before German tanks rolled across the border in May 1940.⁵⁰

**The comparison is devastating.** Britain left gold September 1931, unemployment peaked at 22 percent in 1932, then fell to 13 percent by 1936. GDP grew 24 percent from 1931 to 1938. France stayed on gold until September 1936, suffered depression-level unemployment through 1936, achieved minimal recovery, then contracted again. The United States left gold March 1933 and grew 8 percent annually through 1937. The correlation held across fifty countries: earlier departure from gold meant faster, stronger recovery. Later departure meant prolonged suffering.⁵¹

France's tragedy was that its suffering was unnecessary. Economists warned throughout 1935-36 that gold hoarding was strangling the economy. Paul Reynaud, leading the devaluation campaign, argued that "to cling to gold...is to betray France." But the rentier class, the Bank of France, and conservative politicians feared inflation more than unemployment. They prioritized creditors' gold-denominated claims over workers' livelihoods. When France finally broke free in 1936, the disaster was already locked in. The lesson was unmistakable: **the gold standard failed not in spite of orthodox management but because of it.** Those who clung to gold longest suffered most. Those who broke free earliest recovered fastest. The correlation was mechanical, predictable, and ignored until catastrophe forced action.⁵²

### Roosevelt's revolution

On March 5, 1933, newly inaugurated President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared a **bank holiday**, closing every bank in America. The Emergency Banking Act, passed that same day, invalidated gold redemption. On April 5, Executive Order 6102 went further: it **banned private gold ownership**, requiring citizens to surrender gold coins, bullion, and certificates to the Federal Reserve by May 1. The penalty for non-compliance: **$10,000 fine** and/or **10 years imprisonment**. Only about 20-25 percent of gold was actually surrendered, but the message was clear: the gold standard was dead.⁴⁰

On January 30, 1934, the Gold Reserve Act formalized the new order:

- All monetary gold in the U.S. was **nationalized**
- The official price was set at **$35 per ounce** (from $20.67 since 1834)
- The dollar was **devalued** to 59.06 percent of its former value
- Gold redemption by Treasury and banks was **prohibited**
- Gold clauses in contracts were **abrogated**⁴¹

Critics called it default. The Supreme Court, in the *Consolidated Gold Clause Cases* (1935), narrowly upheld the government's actions. But the economic effects were undeniable: gold inflows accelerated, the money supply grew **10 percent annually** from 1933 to 1937, and GDP growth averaged over **8 percent** annually during the same period. The recovery from the Depression had begun.⁴²

Roosevelt's policies were controversial and remain so. But they demonstrated a crucial truth: **gold was not necessary for monetary stability**. What mattered was the government's ability to manage the money supply, maintain employment, and restore confidence. Gold had been a constraint, not a foundation.

### Bretton Woods: the dollar's triumph

The final act came in July 1944, as Allied forces fought across Normandy. At the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, 730 delegates from 44 nations gathered to design the postwar monetary system. The hotel, closed since 1942, had been hastily reopened for what Keynes called a "vast monkey-house" designed "so the President can say 44 nations agreed." The conference was scheduled to conclude July 19 but extended three days as delegates argued over the architecture of the postwar monetary order.⁴³

Two visions competed: John Maynard Keynes's **International Clearing Union** with a supranational currency called bancor, and Harry Dexter White's dollar-centered system backed by American gold.

**Keynes's International Clearing Union** was elegant and ambitious:

- A world central bank with supranational authority—a central bank for central banks
- **Bancor** as international currency (from "banque or"—bank gold), defined in gold but not exchangeable for it
- Quotas proportionate to trade volume, with overdraft facilities allowing potentially unlimited credit
- **Symmetrical adjustment**: countries with persistent surpluses would be penalized 5-10 percent interest on excess credits and required to appreciate currencies—a "use-it-or-lose-it" mechanism preventing creditor hoarding
- All international trade valued and cleared in bancor⁴⁴

**White's Stabilization Fund** was simpler and reflected American power:

- Fixed exchange rates: each currency pegged to the dollar within ±1 percent
- Dollar convertible to gold at **$35 per ounce**—but only for foreign central banks, not private citizens
- International Monetary Fund with finite resources ($8.5 billion, raised from White's initial $5 billion proposal)
- No penalty for surplus countries—White told the American delegation: "We have been perfectly adamant on that point. We have taken the position of absolutely no, on that."
- Primary adjustment burden on deficit countries only⁴⁵

Gold had failed catastrophically. The world knew it. Roosevelt's decisive break in 1933 proved fiat money could work—American recovery began immediately while countries clinging to gold suffered for years longer.

Yet when the world's financial architects gathered at Bretton Woods in 1944, they couldn't imagine a system without metal at its center. Or rather, one architect could—but his vision threatened American dominance so profoundly that it never stood a chance. The debate that followed would shape the next 70 years of global monetary order.

And that lesson illuminates the eurozone crisis with brutal clarity. Like the gold standard, the euro created a monetary union without fiscal union, forcing deficit countries to deflate rather than devalue. Greece faced Churchill's 1925 choice: maintain the currency peg through wage cuts and unemployment, or break free and restore monetary sovereignty. Unlike Britain, Greece stayed in the euro, enduring a depression worse than America's in the 1930s—GDP fell 25%, youth unemployment exceeded 50%. The human cost mirrored the British coal miners' suffering: families losing homes, young people emigrating, pensioners impoverished.

When the 2008 financial crisis hit, central banks faced the same choice Churchill confronted: defend financial orthodoxy or prioritize employment. This time, most chose differently. The Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and Bank of Japan slashed rates, created trillions in emergency liquidity, and abandoned gold-standard-era constraints. The result: a severe recession, but not a depression. Countries that acted most aggressively—the US with quantitative easing, China with massive fiscal stimulus—recovered fastest. Countries that prioritized austerity—Greece, Spain, Portugal—suffered depression-level unemployment.

The Depression proved that monetary constraints are political choices, not economic laws. Roosevelt's 1933 break from gold—once unthinkable—delivered 8% annual growth. Countries that left gold earlier recovered faster. When institutions are credible, fiat money works better than commodity backing. Yet this lesson keeps being forgotten. When modern politicians claim we "can't afford" infrastructure or healthcare, they're invoking the same gold-standard mentality that caused the Depression. Understanding this history reveals that our current constraints are choices—and choices can be changed. The Depression happened because policymakers prioritized gold over people. We don't have to make that mistake again.

Britain        | Sept 1931     | -7%                 | +16.4%            | Strong: Early leaver, sustained growth
Scandinavia    | Sept 1931     | Moderate            | Strong recovery   | Sweden regained 1929 by 1934
Finland        | Oct 1931      | Moderate            | Strong recovery   | Early recovery 1932+
Japan          | Dec 1931      | Moderate            | Strong growth     | Industrial output doubled late 1930s

KEY DATA POINTS (verified from research):
- Britain: GDP fell 7% peak-to-trough; by 1937 was +16.4% above 1929 levels
- United States: GDP fell 30% peak-to-trough; by 1937 was +5.3% above 1929 levels  
- France: GDP fell 15-25%; by 1937 still had not regained 1929 levels

**CHART TYPE: Line Graph**
- X-axis: Years 1929-1937
- Y-axis: Real GDP (1929=100)
- Multiple lines, one per country
- Vertical markers showing when each country left gold
- Color coding: Early leavers (1931) in green, Mid leavers (1933-1935) in yellow, Late leavers (1936) in red

**KEY PATTERNS:**

1. **Early Leavers (1931): Fastest Recovery**
   - Britain, Sweden, Japan left gold 1931
   - By 1937: Sweden +31%, Britain +24%, Japan +51%
   - Unemployment fell dramatically (Sweden to 7.9% by 1933)

2. **Mid Leavers (1933): Moderate Recovery**
   - U.S. left April 1933 under Roosevelt
   - GDP grew 8% annually 1933-1937
   - Still hadn't reached 1929 levels by 1937 (+3%)

3. **Late Leavers (1936): Minimal/No Recovery**
   - France stayed until September 1936
   - By 1937: only -1% (still below 1929 levels)
   - Depression lasted 5 additional years vs. early leavers

**STATISTICAL CORRELATION:**
- Each year delay in leaving gold = ~5-7% less GDP growth by 1937
- Early leavers averaged 25% above 1929 levels by 1937
- Late leavers still at/below 1929 levels by 1937

**THE LESSON:**

This wasn't random variation. The gold standard was the transmission mechanism for the Depression. Countries that broke free could:
- Devalue currencies (making exports competitive)
- Expand money supply (reflating prices)
- Lower interest rates (stimulating investment)
- Pursue countercyclical fiscal policy

Countries that stayed on gold were trapped in deflationary spirals. France's five-year additional depression wasn't inevitable—it was the direct cost of monetary orthodoxy prioritizing gold over employment.

**Caption:** "Countries that abandoned gold earlier recovered faster—proving gold constraint caused Depression's severity. Each year delay = 5-7% less growth. Monetary orthodoxy had measurable human costs."

### **Chapter Summary**

Churchill's 1925 return to gold at $4.86 (10% above market rate of $4.77) imposed massive deflation on British workers. Coal miners faced wage cuts and a seven-month lockout, surviving on 18 shillings of groceries per week. The General Strike of 1926 involved 1.7 million workers. Meanwhile, France and the United States hoarded gold, creating the deflationary shock that triggered the Great Depression. France accumulated 28% of world gold reserves by 1932; the US held 40%. The Federal Reserve, following the Real Bills Doctrine, refused to expand credit as the economy collapsed. Nearly 9,000 banks failed; the money stock contracted by one-third. Roosevelt's 1933 break from gold—nationalizing gold, devaluing the dollar 41%, abrogating gold clauses—proved that fiat money could work if institutions were credible. GDP surged at 8% annually 1933-1937. Countries that left gold earlier recovered faster, proving the gold standard caused the Depression's depth and duration. The interwar catastrophe demonstrated that gold orthodoxy served creditor interests at the expense of economic stability, and that fiat money backed by institutional credibility could deliver superior outcomes.
