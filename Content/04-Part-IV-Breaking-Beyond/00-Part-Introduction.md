# PART IV: THE BREAKING AND BEYOND

## The Liberation from Gold

Between 1844 and 1914, the accidental gold standard became global orthodoxy. Germany's adoption in 1871—financed by French war reparations paid in gold francs after the Franco-Prussian War—triggered a cascade. The Latin Monetary Union nations followed. Japan, Russia, and Austria-Hungary joined through the 1890s. The United States, despite the populist "free silver" movement that nearly captured the presidency through William Jennings Bryan, formalized its commitment in the Gold Standard Act of 1900. By 1913, nearly every major economy pegged its currency to gold at fixed rates, creating an integrated international monetary system unprecedented in human history.

This globalization was not coordinated planning but competitive necessity driven by power asymmetry. Britain, as the world's dominant economy and primary lender, essentially demanded gold backing as the price of access. To borrow in London—the center of international capital—required a gold-backed currency. To trade with British merchants, to attract British investment, to be taken seriously in global finance, you needed the credibility only gold seemed to provide. The standard spread through power relationships and competitive imitation, not economic logic or scientific proof.

The result was unprecedented monetary integration—and unprecedented systemic vulnerability. Fixed exchange rates linked national economies in ways never before experienced. When one country's gold reserves drained, trading partners felt the contraction ripple through trade balances and capital flows. When central banks raised interest rates to defend gold convertibility, deflation transmitted across borders automatically through the price-specie-flow mechanism. The 1873-1896 "Long Depression"—particularly devastating for agricultural prices as gold supply couldn't expand to match growing trade volumes—offered warning signs that few heeded. The system appeared stable during its 1896-1914 golden age primarily because no major crisis tested it. World War I would shatter that illusion.

The gold standard broke in three stages: 1797 (Bank Restriction during Napoleonic Wars), 1914-1931 (World War I suspension and disastrous return), and 1971 (Nixon's permanent closure of the gold window). Each breaking revealed the same truth: gold was not the foundation of monetary value; trust was. And trust could be built without gold—if the institutions were credible enough.

The final breaking came not through careful planning but through crisis and necessity. Churchill's 1925 return to gold at an overvalued parity triggered deflation and the General Strike. The Great Depression proved that gold's automatic adjustment was a myth—countries that left gold earlier recovered faster. Bretton Woods attempted to preserve gold's discipline while allowing fiat's flexibility, but the compromise contained fatal contradictions. When Nixon closed the gold window in 1971, he ended not just a monetary system but a two-century orthodoxy.

What emerged was something more honest: money as a human institution, created by law and sustained by trust, serving the needs of the economy rather than constraining it. The age of pure fiat began—and with it, new challenges and old debates in modern form.

This Part traces the gold standard's collapse and fiat money's vindication across three chapters:

**Chapter 9** examines the interwar catastrophe. Churchill's 1925 blunder—returning to gold at $4.86 when the market rate was $4.77—imposed 10% deflation on British workers. Coal miners faced wage cuts and a seven-month lockout, surviving on 18 shillings of groceries per week. Meanwhile, France and the United States hoarded gold, creating the deflationary shock that triggered the Great Depression. Roosevelt's 1933 break from gold—nationalizing gold, devaluing the dollar, abrogating gold clauses—proved that fiat money could work if institutions were credible. GDP surged at 8% annually. The recovery had begun.

**Chapter 10** reveals Bretton Woods' attempt to restore gold's discipline while preserving fiat's flexibility. Keynes's bancor—a supranational currency with penalties for surplus countries—lost to White's dollar-centered system backed by American gold. The compromise worked for 27 years but contained the Triffin dilemma: the world needed dollar outflows for liquidity, but persistent deficits undermined gold convertibility. The London Gold Pool hemorrhaged $3 billion trying to defend $35 gold. When Britain requested a $3 billion gold transfer in August 1971, the game was over. Nixon closed the gold window. The suspension announced as temporary became permanent.

**Chapter 11** examines the age of pure fiat from 1971 to the present. The 1970s inflation crisis resulted not from fiat money's inherent failure but from compromised Fed independence under political pressure. Volcker's conquest of inflation—raising rates to 20%, enduring 10.8% unemployment—proved that fiat money could deliver price stability when properly managed. The 2008 crisis provided the definitive test: central banks created trillions without causing inflation because they were replacing destroyed money in an economy operating below capacity. The real constraint on money creation is productive capacity, not gold reserves or government revenues. Cryptocurrency's attempt to return to algorithmic scarcity replicated gold's flaws: fixed supply creates deflation and hoarding, not functional money.

The age of pure fiat is not a departure from monetary history but its logical conclusion: recognition that money has always been a human institution, and institutions endure only when they serve the societies that create them. The challenge is maintaining those institutions across generations, remembering that money is not a thing but a relationship. The temple scribes of Ur understood this. The clerks of the Bank of England understood this. Modern monetary systems depend on the same insight.

Yet liberation from gold brought new challenges of power and distribution. **Fiat money's flexibility serves those who design the transmission mechanism.** When central banks create money through asset purchases, gains flow to wealth-holders. When governments create money through fiscal transfers, benefits reach broader populations. The 2008 quantitative easing that inflated asset prices for the top 10 percent was a choice, not technical necessity—the COVID-19 direct payments demonstrated alternatives. Fiat money freed from gold constraints allows us to serve human needs rather than worship arbitrary metal reserves. But whether that freedom builds broadly shared prosperity or concentrates wealth further depends entirely on whose interests shape monetary policy. The question is never whether we have "enough money"—governments create it by spending. The question is always whose needs that creation serves.
