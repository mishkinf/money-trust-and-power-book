# PART IV: THE BREAKING AND BEYOND

## The Liberation from Gold

Between 1844 and 1914, the accidental gold standard became global orthodoxy. Germany's adoption in 1871—financed by French war reparations paid in gold francs after the Franco-Prussian War—triggered a cascade. The Latin Monetary Union nations followed. Japan, Russia, and Austria-Hungary joined through the 1890s. The United States, despite the populist "free silver" movement that nearly captured the presidency through William Jennings Bryan, formalized its commitment in the Gold Standard Act of 1900. By 1913, nearly every major economy pegged its currency to gold at fixed rates, creating an integrated international monetary system unprecedented in human history.

This globalization was not coordinated planning but competitive necessity driven by power asymmetry. Britain, as the world's dominant economy and primary lender, essentially demanded gold backing as the price of access. To borrow in London—the center of international capital—required a gold-backed currency. To trade with British merchants, to attract British investment, to be taken seriously in global finance, you needed the credibility only gold seemed to provide. The standard spread through power relationships and competitive imitation, not economic logic or scientific proof.

The result was unprecedented monetary integration—and unprecedented systemic vulnerability. Fixed exchange rates linked national economies in ways never before experienced. When one country's gold reserves drained, trading partners felt the contraction ripple through trade balances and capital flows. When central banks raised interest rates to defend gold convertibility, deflation transmitted across borders automatically through the price-specie-flow mechanism. The 1873-1896 "Long Depression"—particularly devastating for agricultural prices as gold supply couldn't expand to match growing trade volumes—offered warning signs that few heeded. The system appeared stable during its 1896-1914 golden age primarily because no major crisis tested it. World War I would shatter that illusion.

The gold standard broke in three stages: 1797 (Bank Restriction during Napoleonic Wars), 1914-1931 (World War I suspension and disastrous return), and 1971 (Nixon's permanent closure of the gold window). Each breaking revealed the same truth: gold was not the foundation of monetary value; trust was. And trust could be built without gold—if the institutions were credible enough.

The final breaking came not through careful planning but through crisis and necessity. Churchill's 1925 return to gold at an overvalued parity triggered deflation and the General Strike. The Great Depression proved that gold's automatic adjustment was a myth—countries that left gold earlier recovered faster. Bretton Woods attempted to preserve gold's discipline while allowing fiat's flexibility, but the compromise contained fatal contradictions. When Nixon closed the gold window in 1971, he ended not just a monetary system but a two-century orthodoxy.

What emerged was something more honest: money as a human institution, created by law and sustained by trust, serving the needs of the economy rather than constraining it. The age of pure fiat began—and with it, new challenges and old debates in modern form.

This Part traces the gold standard's collapse and fiat money's vindication across three chapters:

**Chapter 10** examines the interwar catastrophe—Churchill's 1925 return to gold, France and America's gold hoarding triggering the Great Depression, and Roosevelt's 1933 break proving fiat money could work.

**Chapter 11** reveals Bretton Woods' contradictions—Keynes's bancor losing to White's dollar system, the Triffin dilemma making collapse inevitable, and Nixon's 1971 closure of the gold window.

**Chapter 13** examines pure fiat from 1971 to present—the 2008 crisis proving money creation works when economies operate below capacity, and cryptocurrency repeating gold's fixed-supply failures.

The age of pure fiat is not a departure from monetary history but its logical conclusion: recognition that money has always been a human institution, and institutions endure only when they serve the societies that create them. The challenge is maintaining those institutions across generations, remembering that money is not a thing but a relationship. The temple scribes of Ur understood this. The clerks of the Bank of England understood this. Modern monetary systems depend on the same insight.

Yet liberation from gold brought new challenges of power and distribution. **Fiat money's flexibility serves those who design the transmission mechanism.** When central banks create money through asset purchases, gains flow to wealth-holders. When governments create money through fiscal transfers, benefits reach broader populations. The 2008 quantitative easing that inflated asset prices for the top 10 percent was a choice, not technical necessity—the COVID-19 direct payments demonstrated alternatives. Fiat money freed from gold constraints allows us to serve human needs rather than worship arbitrary metal reserves. But whether that freedom builds broadly shared prosperity or concentrates wealth further depends entirely on whose interests shape monetary policy. The question is never whether we have "enough money"—governments create it by spending. The question is always whose needs that creation serves.
