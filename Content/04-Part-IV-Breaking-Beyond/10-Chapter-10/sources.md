# Chapter 10 Sources & Summary

### **Chapter Summary**

Churchill's 1925 return to gold at $4.86 (10% above market rate of $4.77) imposed massive deflation on British workers. Coal miners faced wage cuts and a seven-month lockout, surviving on 18 shillings of groceries per week. The General Strike of 1926 involved 1.7 million workers. Meanwhile, France and the United States hoarded gold, creating the deflationary shock that triggered the Great Depression. France accumulated 28% of world gold reserves by 1932; the US held 40%. The Federal Reserve, following the Real Bills Doctrine, refused to expand credit as the economy collapsed. Nearly 9,000 banks failed; the money stock contracted by one-third. Roosevelt's 1933 break from gold—nationalizing gold, devaluing the dollar 41%, abrogating gold clauses—proved that fiat money could work if institutions were credible. GDP surged at 8% annually 1933-1937. Countries that left gold earlier recovered faster, proving the gold standard caused the Depression's depth and duration. The interwar catastrophe demonstrated that gold orthodoxy served creditor interests at the expense of economic stability, and that fiat money backed by institutional credibility could deliver superior outcomes.
