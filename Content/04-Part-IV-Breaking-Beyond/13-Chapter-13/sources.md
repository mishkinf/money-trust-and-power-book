# Chapter 13 Sources & Summary

## **Chapter Summary**

The modern fiat system, born from the gold standard's collapse, represents the culmination of five millennia of monetary evolution. The 2008 crisis proved that central banks could create trillions without causing inflation—because they were replacing destroyed money in an economy operating below capacity. The real constraint on money creation is productive capacity, not gold reserves or government revenues. When institutions are credible, fiat money enables flexible response to crises; when institutions fail, inflation results regardless of the monetary system. Cryptocurrency's attempt to return to algorithmic scarcity replicated gold's flaws: fixed supply creates deflation and hoarding, not functional money. The age of fiat is not a departure from monetary history but its logical conclusion: recognition that money has always been a human institution, and institutions endure only when they serve the societies that create them.
