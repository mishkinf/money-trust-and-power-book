# Chapter 12 Sources & Summary

### **Chapter Summary**

Bretton Woods (1944) attempted to restore gold's discipline while preserving fiat's flexibility. Keynes's bancor—a supranational currency with penalties for surplus countries—lost to White's dollar-centered system backed by American gold. The compromise worked for 27 years but contained the Triffin dilemma: the world needed dollar outflows for liquidity, but persistent deficits undermined gold convertibility at $35/ounce. The London Gold Pool hemorrhaged $3 billion trying to defend the price. When Britain requested a $3 billion gold transfer in August 1971, Nixon closed the gold window. The suspension announced as temporary became permanent. The system had failed not because fiat money doesn't work but because the compromise tried to preserve gold's constraint while allowing fiat's flexibility—an inherent contradiction. Countries that left gold earlier in the 1930s had recovered faster, proving gold caused economic damage rather than preventing it. The final breaking revealed what 1797 and 1933 had shown: gold was never the foundation of monetary value; institutional credibility was. Money is a human institution, created by law and sustained by trust, serving economic needs rather than constraining them.
