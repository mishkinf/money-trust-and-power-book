# PART IV: THE BREAKING AND BEYOND

## Chapter 11: Bretton Woods and the Bancor That Wasn't

**Chapter Premise:** In July 1944, as Allied forces fought across Normandy, 730 delegates from 44 nations gathered at Mount Washington Hotel to design the postwar monetary system. Keynes's bancor—a supranational currency with symmetric adjustment—lost to White's dollar-centered system backed by American gold. The compromise established dollar dominance but contained the seeds of its own destruction.

### China's Dollar Trap

As of March 2025, China holds approximately $765-800 billion in U.S. Treasury securities,⁴³ᵃ down from earlier peaks but still representing a substantial creditor position to the United States. Yet Chinese officials increasingly worry about this position. The dollar's value depends on American fiscal discipline and Federal Reserve policy—neither of which China controls. If the dollar weakens, China's reserves lose value. If China tries to sell, the resulting crash would destroy the value of its remaining holdings.

This resembles France's 1960s position but operates under fundamentally different constraints. France could test the Bretton Woods system by demanding gold—exposing the material limit of $35/ounce convertibility. China cannot. Under pure fiat, there's no convertibility promise to test, no gold reserves to exhaust. The United States, as a sovereign currency issuer, cannot run out of dollars. What China faces isn't the Triffin dilemma but a different challenge: the political risk of holding assets denominated in another nation's currency. The vulnerability is to American policy decisions and geopolitical power, not to American insolvency.

The 2008 financial crisis revealed both the power and the fragility of this arrangement. When credit markets froze globally, only the Federal Reserve could provide the dollars the world economy needed. The Fed created $583 billion in currency swap lines with 14 foreign central banks—essentially printing dollars for other countries to use.⁴³ᵇ This demonstrated that the dollar's reserve status gives the U.S. extraordinary power: the Fed is the world's central bank by default.

But it also revealed the system's vulnerability. If confidence in the dollar ever truly collapsed, there's no gold to fall back on, no automatic stabilizer. The system works entirely on institutional credibility. Understanding how this system emerged—and why the gold-backed alternative failed—illuminates the constraints and possibilities of our current monetary order.

**This chapter examines the 1944 Bretton Woods conference where the postwar monetary system was designed.** We'll explore how Keynes's bancor—a supranational currency with symmetric adjustment preventing persistent imbalances—lost to White's dollar-centered system that privileged American power. The conference dynamics reveal how 730 delegates from 44 nations negotiated for three weeks while the real decisions had already been made in Washington. American gold holdings (80% of global reserves) gave the U.S. overwhelming leverage. The system that emerged worked brilliantly for 27 years but contained a fatal contradiction that would force its eventual collapse—a collapse examined in the next chapter.

### July 1944: The Mount Washington Hotel

One month after D-Day, as Allied forces fought across Normandy, 730 delegates from 44 nations gathered at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. The timing was deliberate—the Allies were winning the war, and America was determined to win the peace. Organizers scheduled the conference for July 1-22, 1944, but extended it three days as delegates argued over details already decided in Washington.⁴⁹ᵃ

The Mount Washington Hotel, isolated in New Hampshire's White Mountains, offered spectacular views and no easy exit. Delegates arrived to find what Lionel Robbins, head of Britain's Economic Section of the War Cabinet, called "glorious confusion." The Americans, despite their "virtues as technicians," were, as Robbins noted in his private diary, "not good organisers of international conferences. The administration here is quite incredibly bad."⁴⁹ᵃ⁻¹ But the chaos served American purposes perfectly—it gave them control while appearing merely incompetent.

The isolation was strategic. Delegates couldn't easily consult their governments before committing to positions. Conference organizers controlled the agenda, the documents, and the timeline. Mail was slow, transatlantic calls expensive and monitored. Decisions made at the Mount Washington Hotel would be difficult to reverse once delegates returned home. This wasn't an accident of location—it was careful design.

The ostensible purpose was designing the postwar international monetary system through collaborative negotiation between sovereign equals. The real purpose was securing American monetary dominance while creating enough appearance of consultation to ensure other nations would ratify what had already been decided in Washington. What looked like a conference was actually a carefully choreographed demonstration of American power.

**The Power Asymmetry**

The numbers told the story. The United States held approximately $20.6 billion of the world's monetary gold—roughly 75-80% of global reserves. Britain, by contrast, faced crushing wartime debts: having received approximately $20-22 billion in cumulative Lend-Lease aid by June 1944, plus £1.3 billion in sterling balances owed to India and other colonies. British gold and dollar reserves stood at only $1.5-2.0 billion—less than 10% of American holdings.⁴⁹ᵃ⁻²

The military situation reinforced financial realities. American factories operated at full capacity while British industry had been bombed. American troops were fed, British cities rationed. The United States was creditor; Britain was debtor. As Robbins would confess to American Treasury official Fred Vinson: "We know we will be beaten and we hope to avoid being humiliated."⁴⁹ᵈ The distinction between defeat and humiliation would prove meaningless. Britain experienced both.

**The Central Figures**

John Maynard Keynes, 61, led the British delegation. The most famous economist of his generation—whose 1919 *Economic Consequences of the Peace* had predicted Versailles Treaty disaster and whose 1936 *General Theory* had revolutionized macroeconomics—arrived at Bretton Woods with an ambitious proposal. The bancor: a supranational currency that would make gold obsolete and create symmetric adjustment between creditor and debtor nations. It was elegant, economically sound, and politically impossible.

Keynes was celebrity, but celebrity without power. His health was deteriorating after years of wartime Treasury work. He had already suffered one heart attack. The altitude, stress, and marathon negotiating sessions would take a brutal toll. But he came to Bretton Woods believing intellectual force and moral argument could still shape the postwar order. He was wrong.

Harry Dexter White, 52, represented the United States as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. Less famous than Keynes but holding the leverage that mattered: American gold, American factories, American power. Methodical, bureaucratic, and completely clear about his mission. His alternative to bancor was simpler: make the dollar the world's reserve currency, backed by American gold at $35 per ounce. No need for supranational institutions when the United States already dominated.

White understood the negotiating dynamic perfectly. As he told his delegation, U.S. gold reserves in Fort Knox were "why the United States is in an enviable position...why we are in a powerful position in this Conference...why we dominate practically the financial world, because we have the where-with-all to buy any currency we want." When discussing whether to press their advantage, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau was explicit: "Now the advantage is ours here, and I personally think we should take it." White agreed: "If the advantage was theirs, they would take it."⁴⁹ᵇ

The conference outcome was never in doubt. As the New York World-Telegram noted with characteristic American directness: "The kid who owns the ball is usually captain."⁴⁹ᶻ

### Inside the Conference: Power Disguised as Negotiation

On July 1, American officials distributed pre-drafted proposals for the International Monetary Fund already reflecting American positions on voting weights, governance structure, and reserve currency status—documents finalized at the Atlantic City preliminary conference just days earlier.⁴⁹ᶜ British delegates arrived expecting genuine negotiation but found, as Lionel Robbins confided to U.S. Treasury official Fred Vinson, "We know we will be beaten and we hope to avoid being humiliated."⁴⁹ᵈ

**The Keynes-White Dynamic**

While Keynes commanded intellectual attention—delegates still quoted his 1919 prediction of Versailles disaster—White controlled the procedural machinery that determined outcomes. Committee assignments, working group agendas, document drafting schedules, the timing of votes: all flowed through White's hands as chairman of Commission I. The power dynamic became visible in small moments that revealed the larger truth.

When Keynes protested an American draft in October 1943 preliminary negotiations—"This is intolerable. It is yet another Talmud. We had better simply break off negotiations"—White's reply dripped with condescension: "We will try to produce something which Your Highness can understand."⁴⁹ᵉ The great economist was being dismissed as too simple-minded to grasp American proposals. The insult was calculated.

**White's Strategy of Procedural Control**

White was explicit about his strategy with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and his own team. As chairman of Commission I, he aimed "to prevent coming to a vote on matters which he doesn't wish to come to a vote on, and in general arranging the discussion in such a way that we are never caught with an agreement among the Commission on something we don't want."⁴⁹ᶠ

This wasn't hidden manipulation—it was deliberate procedural dominance exercised in plain sight. White would recognize speakers who supported American positions, extend time for working groups developing proposals Washington favored, and call votes when momentum favored U.S. interests. When opposition coalesced, he would table discussion, refer issues to subcommittees, or declare them beyond the commission's scope.

The physical toll reinforced his control. Conference sessions ran morning to night. Working groups met through meals. Delegates received hundreds of pages of technical documents requiring evening review for the next day's sessions. Keynes, already exhausted from wartime Treasury work, found the pace devastating. Robbins noted the "glorious confusion" served American purposes—exhausted delegates made fewer objections, sought quicker resolutions, signed what was put before them.

The rushed final proceedings, combined with Keynes's heart attack on July 19, gave White maximum leverage at the critical moment. British delegation leadership was literally incapacitated while final agreements required signatures.

**The Bancor's Procedural Death**

Keynes's International Clearing Union—the bancor system with symmetric adjustment—never came to a vote at Bretton Woods. It had already been killed in preliminary negotiations months before delegates arrived in New Hampshire. Understanding how requires looking at the timeline:

**April 21, 1944:** The "Joint Statement by Experts on the Establishment of an International Monetary Fund" was published. This document, presented as a compromise between British and American positions, already reflected White's IMF proposal much more than Keynes's ICU. The bancor as supranational currency had vanished from the agenda. Symmetric adjustment was gone. What remained was a dollar-centered fund with limited resources.

**May 25, 1944:** The United States issued formal invitations to the Bretton Woods Conference. The invitation specified that delegates would meet "for the purpose of formulating definite proposals for an International Monetary Fund." No mention of the International Clearing Union. No mention of alternative currency systems. The agenda had been set before anyone arrived.

**June 15-30, 1944:** The Atlantic City preliminary conference finalized draft documents. American Treasury lawyers worked with select delegates to prepare Articles of Agreement for the IMF and World Bank. The working documents used "gold-convertible exchange" throughout—language that would later be explicitly defined as meaning U.S. dollars.

**July 1, 1944:** When delegates arrived at Bretton Woods, they received pre-drafted documents embodying American positions on voting weights, governance, and currency arrangements. The conference structure reinforced this:

- **Commission I:** The Fund (President: Harry Dexter White)
- **Commission II:** The Bank (President: John Maynard Keynes)
- **Commission III:** Other Measures of International Financial Cooperation

The symbolism was clear. White would chair discussions of the monetary system—the Fund that would use dollars as reserves. Keynes was relegated to the World Bank, focused on reconstruction lending. The International Clearing Union, if mentioned at all, belonged to Commission III's "other measures."

The conference proceeded to discuss details of the Fund and Bank. Voting quotas. Governance structures. Drawing rights. All within the framework of White's dollar-centered system. Keynes could propose amendments to IMF articles, but the fundamental architecture—dollar as reserve currency, limited fund resources, asymmetric adjustment—was not open for debate.

When British delegates raised features of the bancor system, American chairs ruled them "out of scope" from working groups focused on IMF implementation. The distinction was devastating: working groups discussed "how" the IMF would function, not "whether" it should exist instead of alternatives.

**Why Smaller Nations Supported This**

Smaller countries understood the power dynamic. They faced anticipated "dollar shortages"—insufficient dollar reserves to pay for imports from the United States. Access to IMF loans required supporting the American plan. Post-war reconstruction assistance would flow through American-controlled institutions. Antagonizing Washington meant risking exclusion from the emerging financial architecture.

As one Latin American delegate privately acknowledged, his government instructed him to vote with the United States on all major issues. The Americans had the gold, the industrial capacity, and the military power. Opposition would be remembered.

By conference end, Keynes recognized defeat was complete. In December 1944, he explained to the Foreign Office that delegates "had to sign, of course, before we had had a chance of reading through a clean and consecutive copy of the document. All we had seen of it was the dotted line."⁴⁹ʰ

**July 13: The Decisive Moment**

The turning point came on July 13, 1944, during a Commission I session discussing the IMF's Articles of Agreement. The draft document referred repeatedly to "gold and gold-convertible exchange" as the assets countries could use to meet their obligations to the Fund. But what, exactly, did "gold-convertible exchange" mean?

A.D. Shroff, representing India, asked the question that had been hanging unspoken over the entire conference: "I think it is high time that the USA delegation give us a definition of gold and gold convertible exchange."⁴⁹ⁱ

The room understood what Shroff was really asking. Would "gold-convertible exchange" mean any major currency? Would sterling qualify? Would multiple currencies share reserve status, creating the multilateral system Keynes wanted? Or would this be a dollar system disguised in neutral language?

Edward Bernstein of the U.S. delegation replied with careful vagueness: "Mr Chairman, it might be possible to give a definition...but it would involve a long discussion...it would be easier for this purpose to regard the United States dollar as what was intended when we speak of gold convertible exchange."⁴⁹ʲ

The answer was elegant in its evasiveness. "Easier for this purpose" suggested temporary convenience rather than permanent architecture. But everyone in the room understood the implication. The IMF would operate in dollars. Countries would hold dollars as reserves. The dollar was being placed at the center of the postwar monetary system—not through formal vote or explicit provision, but through linguistic sleight of hand.

What happened next revealed the depth of British defeat. Dennis Robertson of the British delegation—notably, not Keynes—then proposed formal language for the Articles: "payment of official gold and subscription should be expressed official holdings of gold and United States dollars."⁴⁹ᵏ

A British delegate had just enshrined dollar dominance in the text. Why?

The answer lay in the fractures within the British Empire. India, represented by Shroff, was seeking protection from sterling weakness. The pound was overvalued, British gold reserves were minimal, and sterling balances (£1.3 billion owed to India and other colonies) represented British debts that might never be fully repaid. Indian officials wanted IMF obligations denominated in something more reliable than the pound: either gold (which Britain lacked) or dollars (which America had).

Robertson, recognizing that sterling couldn't serve as a reserve currency in Britain's weakened state and that blocking dollar provisions would leave India unprotected, chose to accept American dominance explicitly rather than fight a battle Britain had already lost. It was capitulation dressed as pragmatism.

The irony was profound: It was not Americans who formally placed the dollar at the system's center but a fissure within the British Empire (India seeking protection from sterling weakness) and a British economist acknowledging that only the dollar had sufficient strength. American power had been so complete that Britain's own delegates enacted American preferences.

**What "Compromise" Actually Meant**

American negotiators offered tactical concessions to create appearance of give-and-take: Fund size increased to $8.5 billion (Keynes had wanted $26 billion), and a "scarce currency clause" allowed rationing currencies in short supply—theoretically applicable to dollars but never actually used.⁴⁹ˡ

These concessions cost America nothing while allowing other nations to claim negotiating victories to sell domestically. The core architecture remained unchanged: dollar-centered, American-controlled, designed to prevent the symmetric adjustment that Keynes's bancor would have imposed.

By conference end, 730 delegates had debated, voted, and signed agreements. The appearance of democratic negotiation was complete. The reality was that American gold reserves had dictated outcomes before the first delegate arrived.

### The Battle of Systems: Bancor vs. Dollar

The conference presented a choice between two fundamentally different monetary architectures. Understanding what was rejected illuminates why what was accepted eventually failed.⁴⁹ᵏ

**Think of it like choosing between two ways to organize neighborhood trade:**

**Keynes's bancor** = A community credit system where everyone tracks debts in "neighborhood points." No one needs actual dollars. If you mow lawns, you get 10 points. When you need groceries, you spend 10 points. The system automatically balances—anyone accumulating too many points gets charged storage fees, encouraging them to spend. No one can hoard, no one gets special privileges, and the neighborhood never runs out of "money" because points are created as needed for trade.

**White's dollar standard** = Everyone must trade using actual U.S. dollars owned by your wealthy neighbor Bob. To trade with each other, you all need Bob's dollars. Bob lends them out, but eventually you owe Bob interest. If Bob stops lending or demands payment, the whole neighborhood's trade freezes. Bob accumulates wealth from interest payments while everyone else competes for his dollars. Bob gets special treatment because he owns the currency you all must use.

The choice was between a neutral system (bancor) and one privileging American power (dollars). America chose its own advantage.⁴⁹ᵏ⁻¹

#### Keynes's International Clearing Union (Bancor System)

**Currency:**

- Supranational bancor (from "banque or"—bank gold)
- Defined in gold but **NOT exchangeable for gold**
- No single nation's currency privileged
- All international trade valued and cleared in bancor⁴⁹ˡ

**Liquidity Provision:**

- Unlimited overdraft facilities based on trade quotas
- Quotas proportionate to trade volume
- Automatic expansion as world trade grows
- No country faces currency shortage
- International Clearing Union functions as central bank for central banks⁴⁹ᵐ

**Adjustment Mechanism:**

- **SYMMETRIC**: Pressure on both surplus AND deficit countries
- Surplus countries charged 5-10% interest on large excess credits
- Persistent surpluses trigger mandatory currency appreciation
- "Use it or lose it" mechanism prevents creditor hoarding
- Both sides bear responsibility for correcting imbalances⁴⁹ⁿ

**Governance:**

- International Clearing Union with supranational authority
- Decisions made by international board
- No single country veto power
- Democratic international institution⁴⁹ᵒ

**The Triffin Dilemma: When Being the World's Banker Becomes Impossible**

Imagine you're the only person at a party with cash when everyone wants to split the pizza bill. You hand out IOUs so people can settle up with each other: "I owe you $10" notes that people trade around.

This works great initially. Your IOUs solve everyone's payment problems. But the more IOUs you write, the more people wonder: "Can this guy actually pay us all back if we all show up at once?" Too few IOUs and the party can't function. Too many and nobody trusts them.

You're trapped: the party needs your IOUs to work, but providing enough IOUs to meet that need undermines confidence in your ability to redeem them.

This was the United States' position under Bretton Woods. The world needed dollars for trade, but providing enough dollars required deficits that undermined the gold backing. The contradiction was structural, not solvable.

**[VISUAL-AID-11.1] Figure 11.1: The Triffin Dilemma Visualization**

```
THE STRUCTURAL CONTRADICTION OF BRETTON WOODS

World needs dollars for:          BUT confidence in dollar requires:
• International trade             • Limited dollar supply
• Reserve holdings                • US doesn't run deficits
• Development finance             • Gold backing stays credible
• Liquidity in crises             • $35/oz parity maintained

         ↓                                    ↓

    US MUST                              US MUST NOT
  run deficits                          run deficits
  (supply dollars                     (maintain confidence
   to the world)                       in gold convertibility)

                    ↓
              CONTRADICTION
            System must fail

What actually happened (1944-1971):
├─ 1944-1958: Dollar shortage (world desperately needs more dollars)
├─ 1959-1965: Dollar glut begins (too many dollars issued)
├─ 1965-1968: Gold drain accelerates (foreign claims > US reserves)
├─ 1968: Gold Pool collapses, two-tier gold market created
└─ Aug 15, 1971: Nixon closes gold window (system collapses)

The dilemma was structural—no policy could solve it.
Bancor would have eliminated this contradiction entirely.
```

*Note: Robert Triffin identified this paradox in 1960, warning that Bretton Woods contained the seeds of its own destruction. He was right: by 1971, foreign dollar claims ($80B+) far exceeded US gold reserves ($10B), making the $35/oz promise mathematically impossible to keep. The system didn't fail due to policy errors—it failed due to design flaws that were visible from the start.*

**The Triffin Dilemma:**

- **SOLVED**: No single currency needed for reserves
- Bancor created as needed for trade settlement
- No country must run deficits to supply world liquidity
- Structural contradiction eliminated by design⁴⁹ᵖ

---

#### White's Stabilization Fund (Dollar Standard)

**Currency:**

- U.S. dollar as primary reserve currency
- Dollar convertible to gold at $35/ounce
- **FOR OFFICIAL HOLDERS ONLY** (foreign central banks and governments, not private citizens)
- Dollar privileged as "good as gold"
- National currencies used, not supranational money⁴⁹ᵍ

**Liquidity Provision:**

- Limited IMF resources ($8.5 billion initial quota)
- Finite pool, not automatic expansion
- Countries can exhaust IMF borrowing capacity
- Dollar shortages possible and inevitable
- Subscriptions and quotas system, not clearing union⁴⁹ʳ

**Adjustment Mechanism:**

- **ASYMMETRIC**: Pressure only on deficit countries
- Surplus countries face no penalties or interest charges
- No requirement to appreciate currency or reduce surpluses
- "Beggar thy neighbor" policies possible for surplus nations
- White to American delegation: "We have been perfectly adamant on that point. We have taken the position of absolutely no, on that."⁴⁹ˢ

**Governance:**

- IMF voting weighted by quota contributions
- U.S. contributes most, therefore effective veto power
- Washington location ensures American influence
- American interests control major decisions⁴⁹ᵗ

**The Triffin Dilemma:**

- **CREATED**: World needs dollars for trade and reserves
- U.S. must run balance-of-payments deficits to supply dollars
- Persistent deficits undermine gold convertibility promise
- **STRUCTURAL CONTRADICTION** built into system design⁴⁹ᵘ

### Why Keynes's System Was Superior

From pure economic design perspective, bancor solved problems the dollar standard created:

1. **Prevented the Triffin dilemma** before it emerged—no reserve currency paradox when using supranational money
2. **Symmetric adjustment** prevented persistent imbalances (like China's modern surpluses or interwar French gold hoarding)
3. **Unlimited liquidity** matched automatically to actual trade needs, preventing deflationary dollar shortages
4. **No "exorbitant privilege"** for any single nation—all countries operated under same rules⁴⁹ᵛ

The system's economic logic was impeccable. White couldn't refute it on economic grounds. He opposed it on **political grounds**: it asked America to surrender advantages.⁴⁹ʷ

---

### Why America Chose Dollar Standard Anyway

The choice wasn't about economic optimality. It was about power—and American policymakers were brutally clear about this in private.

White understood perfectly that bancor was economically superior for the **international system**. But his job wasn't designing the best system for global trade. His job was advancing **American interests**. And American interests required dollar dominance.

The advantages were substantial and explicit:

**1. Seigniorage Profits**

America would earn interest on dollars held abroad as reserves while creating them costlessly. Every foreign central bank holding dollar reserves was essentially providing an interest-free loan to the United States. This "exorbitant privilege," as French Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d'Estaing would later call it, allowed the U.S. to finance consumption and investment through money creation rather than taxation or borrowing.

**2. Monetary Autonomy**

The U.S. could set monetary policy independently based on domestic considerations. Other countries would have to adjust to American decisions—tightening when the Fed tightened, loosening when the Fed loosened. Under bancor's symmetric system, America would face the same adjustment pressures as everyone else. Dollar dominance meant freedom from external constraints.

**3. Political Leverage**

Dollar access would become a strategic weapon. Countries dependent on dollar reserves and dollar-denominated trade would need American goodwill. The modern use of financial sanctions—freezing assets, cutting off SWIFT access, blocking dollar transactions—demonstrates this power. The bancor would have been immune to single-nation political control.

**4. Veto Power Over Global Finance**

American control of the IMF, through weighted voting based on economic size and contributions, meant the U.S. could prevent any decisions contrary to American interests. No IMF loan to countries Washington opposed. No pressure on American policies. No symmetric adjustment requirements that would constrain U.S. deficits.

White told the American delegation in July 1944 with remarkable candor: "Gold in Fort Knox is why the United States is in an enviable position...why we are in a powerful position in this Conference...why we dominate practically the financial world, because we have the where-with-all to buy any currency we want."⁴⁹ʸ When discussing whether to press American advantages on institutional location and governance, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau was explicit: "Now the advantage is ours here, and I personally think we should take it." White agreed without hesitation: "If the advantage was theirs, they would take it."

**What Bancor Would Have Cost America**

Bancor would have eliminated every one of these advantages. Instead of financing consumption with printed dollars, the U.S. would have faced symmetric adjustment—running surpluses when bancor reserves ran low, just like any other country. The power to sustain persistent deficits would disappear. The ability to borrow at artificially low rates (because foreign central banks needed dollar reserves) would vanish. Strategic leverage through dollar access would be impossible—bancor couldn't be weaponized because no single nation controlled it.

On the specific issue of symmetric adjustment—penalties on surplus countries that hoarded reserves—White was adamant. When asked whether the U.S. would accept such provisions, he told his delegation: "We have been perfectly adamant on that point. We have taken the position of absolutely no."⁴⁹ˢ This wasn't negotiable. American surpluses would never face the same pressure as other countries' deficits.

**What America Sacrificed**

In exchange for these national advantages, America sacrificed:

- A stable, sustainable international monetary system free of structural contradictions
- Prevention of the Triffin dilemma that would eventually destroy dollar convertibility
- Reduced risk of future dollar crises and gold runs
- Long-term systemic benefits for global trade that come from symmetric adjustment
- The opportunity to build genuine multilateral institutions not dominated by any single power

American policymakers made this choice consciously. They understood that a dollar-centered system contained the seeds of its own destruction—that eventually, foreign dollar claims would exceed American gold reserves, making convertibility promises unsustainable. Robert Triffin would formalize this contradiction in 1960, but the problem was visible to anyone doing the arithmetic in 1944.

The calculation was cold-blooded but clear: twenty-seven years of dollar dominance (1944-1971) was worth the eventual crisis. Short-term national advantage trumped long-term systemic stability. White understood bancor's economic logic but opposed it because his job was advancing American power, not designing optimal institutions.

Keynes had bet on reason defeating power. He lost.

### The Decisive Moment

The turning point came on **July 13, 1944**. A.D. Shroff of the Indian delegation questioned the meaning of "gold and gold-convertible exchange":

> "I think it is high time that the USA delegation give us a definition of gold and gold convertible exchange."

Edward Bernstein of the U.S. delegation replied:

> "Mr Chairman, it might be possible to give a definition...but it would involve a long discussion...it would be easier for this purpose to regard the United States dollar as what was intended when we speak of gold convertible exchange."

Dennis Robertson of the British delegation then proposed the text read: "payment of official gold and subscription should be expressed official holdings of gold and United States dollars."

The irony was profound. It was not the Americans who placed the dollar at the system's center but a fissure within the British Empire—India seeking protection from sterling weakness—and a British economist acknowledging that only the dollar had sufficient strength. The kid who owned the ball would indeed be captain of the team.⁴⁹ᶻ

By July 1944, bancor had already been abandoned—not through conference debate but through prior Washington decisions. British delegates arrived to negotiate a system already designed in American interests. When Keynes protested an American draft in October 1943—"This is intolerable. It is yet another Talmud. We had better simply break off negotiations"—White's reply captured the power imbalance perfectly: "We will try to produce something which Your Highness can understand."⁴⁹ᶜ

The Americans offered tactical compromises to create the appearance of negotiation. The Fund size increased from initial proposals to $8.5 billion. A "scarce currency clause" allowed rationing of currencies in short supply—theoretically applicable to dollars but never actually used. Exchange rates could adjust for "fundamental disequilibrium"—vague enough to mean anything or nothing. The World Bank was created for long-term development finance, sweetening the package for debtor nations.⁴⁹ᵈ

But on core issues, American positions were non-negotiable: no bancor (only dollars as reserve currency), no unlimited credit mechanisms (only limited IMF quotas), no penalties on surplus countries (only pressure on deficit countries), no governance structure diluting American control (voting weighted by economic size, ensuring US veto power). These weren't negotiating positions—they were fait accompli disguised as proposals.⁴⁹ᵉ

### Keynes's Defeat

The conference atmosphere reflected these tensions from the start. Lionel Robbins confessed to American Treasury official Fred Vinson during the opening days: **"We know we will be beaten and we hope to avoid being humiliated."**⁴⁹ʲ⁻¹ The distinction between defeat and humiliation would prove meaningless. Britain experienced both.

But Robbins could at least recognize reality. The human cost fell most heavily on Keynes, who had invested years of intellectual work in the bancor proposal. He came to Bretton Woods exhausted from wartime Treasury negotiations, already weakened by a previous heart attack, hoping that the force of his arguments and the elegance of his economic design could still matter. He believed that even bankrupt Britain, if it had logic on its side, could shape the postwar order.

He was watching that hope die with each passing day.

**The Physical Collapse**

The conference took its toll immediately. Robbins noted the "glorious confusion" of the chaotic organization, but for Keynes the chaos was physiological. The altitude of the White Mountains stressed his damaged heart. Marathon negotiating sessions ran late into the night. Delegates worked through meals. The grand hotel, despite its spectacular views, offered no respite from the pressure of negotiating Britain's financial future while knowing the outcome was already decided.

Robbins watched his delegation leader deteriorate: **"I now feel that it is a race between the exhaustion of his powers and the termination of the conference."**⁴⁹ʲ⁻⁴ The race was lost on July 19, 1944, when Keynes collapsed on the hotel stairs from a heart attack. German newspapers, somehow receiving word of the collapse, published adulatory obituaries. Keynes survived, but the Americans extended the conference three more days—forcing the medically compromised British delegation to continue negotiations from a position of maximum weakness.

Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, aware that delegates were exhausted and agreements unsigned, threatened to end the conference by force: "We may have to get the President to get out an order to seize the hotel as of Wednesday night, and put troops in here to run it." Under this explicit threat—sign now or be thrown out—delegates signed documents they hadn't fully read.

Keynes's December 1944 letter to the Foreign Office, written months after the conference when the full implications had become clear, captures the coercion disguised as cooperation:

> "We, all of us, had to sign, of course, before we had had a chance of reading through a clean and consecutive copy of the document. All we had seen of it was the dotted line. Our only excuse is the knowledge that our hosts had made final arrangements to throw us out of the hotel, unhouselled, disappointed, unaneled, within a few hours."⁴⁹

The Shakespearean reference to Hamlet—dying without last rites—captured Keynes's sense of Britain's unceremonious exit from financial leadership. The nation that had managed the world's reserve currency for a century was being expelled from a hotel, signing documents it hadn't read, accepting terms it couldn't refuse.

**The Personal Cost**

Keynes continued fighting for better terms in subsequent negotiations. The Bretton Woods agreements required British Parliamentary ratification, and the United States wanted British implementation to legitimize the dollar standard. This gave Keynes limited leverage to negotiate a postwar loan—the money Britain desperately needed to survive economically.

The loan negotiations, which stretched into 1945, were what Keynes himself described as "absolute hell." Britain needed $3.75 billion,⁴⁹ᵃ⁻³ but the Americans attached conditions: immediate sterling convertibility, dismantling of imperial preferences, acceptance of the Bretton Woods system. Each condition weakened Britain's economic autonomy while strengthening American dominance.

His final international appearance came at Savannah in March 1946 for the inaugural meetings of the IMF and World Bank. British Treasury official Paul Bareau later described how "we lost on every issue, not by the process of rational argument in debate but by the solid massing of the cohorts which voted automatically with America." Latin American delegations "could be depended on to read sometimes with considerable difficulty the speeches prepared for them by the Secretariat of the United States delegation."⁴⁹ᵍ

Keynes had anticipated the Savannah trip as "a pleasant interlude" but found only further defeats. **"I went to Savannah to meet the world," Keynes said, "and all I met was a tyrant."**⁴⁹ʲ⁻¹⁰

Two months later, in April 1946, he suffered a second massive heart attack and died at his home in Sussex. He was 62 years old. Some contemporaries attributed his death to the exhaustion of securing a grudging postwar loan from the Americans while watching his bancor proposal—his vision of a truly international monetary system—buried under American gold reserves.

**What Robbins Documented**

Robbins's diary entries from Bretton Woods provide contemporary evidence of how American power, not economic merit, established the dollar standard. He documented British delegates' awareness they had no leverage. He recorded the administrative chaos that served American purposes. He noted the contemptuous treatment of British proposals. And he watched Keynes, the greatest economist of the age, reduced to negotiating footnotes while the fundamental architecture was decided by whoever held the gold.

This was not negotiation between equals. It was capitulation by the weak to terms set by the strong. The Bretton Woods "agreement" was American monetary architecture accepted by nations with no alternative. As Belgian delegation head Georges Theunis confronted Robbins: **"It is a disgrace. The Americans give way to the Russians every time. And you too, you British, are just as bad. You are on your knees to them."**⁴⁹ʲ⁻⁵

Robbins couldn't deny it.

### What Was Lost

The Bretton Woods system that emerged was not truly a gold standard but a **dollar standard** with gold as window dressing. The critical asymmetry: only foreign central banks and governments could convert dollars to gold at $35 per ounce—not private parties. This "**exorbitant privilege**," as French Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d'Estaing would later call it, was the system's foundation.⁵⁰

Think of it this way: imagine you could pay your mortgage by writing IOUs in "Steve-Dollars" that your bank must accept, but your bank can't pay its obligations in Steve-Dollars—it must get real dollars from someone else. That asymmetry is America's exorbitant privilege. The US can print dollars to pay debts; everyone else must earn or borrow dollars they cannot create.

The mechanics worked smoothly at first. Countries maintained fixed exchange rates by buying or selling dollars. When imbalances emerged, the IMF provided short-term liquidity. When "fundamental disequilibrium" occurred, countries could devalue. The system facilitated postwar reconstruction and enabled unprecedented trade expansion.⁵¹

For 25 years (1946-1971), Bretton Woods delivered remarkable results: stable exchange rates provided certainty for international trade, global GDP grew at unprecedented rates, international trade expanded faster than at any prior period, and inflation remained moderate across most developed economies. The "Golden Age of Capitalism" rested on the foundation of the dollar-gold system.⁵²ᵃ

Between 1950 and 1973, global GDP grew at an average annual rate of 4.9 percent—significantly higher than the 3.0 percent average from 1973-1998 or the 1.3 percent average during the interwar gold standard period (1919-1939). International trade expanded even faster, growing at 8.2 percent annually from 1950-1973.⁵²ᵇ⁻ᶜ

Capital controls—restrictions on cross-border money movements—played a crucial but underappreciated role. Bretton Woods explicitly permitted and even encouraged countries to restrict capital flows while maintaining current account convertibility. This allowed governments to pursue full employment policies without fearing capital flight. The system prioritized productive trade over speculative finance.⁵²ᵈ

But it contained a fatal flaw that economist Robert Triffin would identify in his 1959-60 Congressional testimony. The system needed growing dollar supply for expanding world trade, but dollar convertibility required limiting supply to match gold reserves. Once "outstanding dollar liabilities to the rest of the world would eventually exceed the US monetary gold stock," a "classic bank run" would occur.⁵²ᵍ

The question was not whether the system would collapse, but when.

### The Road Ahead

The Bretton Woods system emerged from American power, not economic logic. Keynes's bancor would have prevented the contradictions that would tear the system apart within 27 years. But the United States held roughly 80% of the world's gold in 1944, and the kid who owns the ball decides the rules.

The dollar standard was born—not because it was economically sound but because it was American. The question was not whether it would work indefinitely, but how long before the contradictions Keynes had warned about became unbearable.

**What the World Lost**

The rejection of bancor meant the world lost its chance at a genuinely multilateral monetary system. Instead of a supranational currency managed by international institutions, the postwar order would depend on one nation's economic strength, political discipline, and willingness to subordinate domestic policy to international obligations.

For 27 years (1946-1971), the system would work brilliantly—delivering the highest sustained economic growth rates in modern history, enabling unprecedented trade expansion, and facilitating European and Japanese reconstruction. The "Golden Age of Capitalism" would rest on the foundation of dollar-gold convertibility at $35 per ounce.

But the system worked precisely because it wasn't tested. Foreign central banks held dollars as reserves but refrained from converting them to gold in large quantities. American policymakers maintained fiscal and monetary discipline. The dollar shortage of the 1950s meant countries wanted more dollars, not fewer. These conditions wouldn't last.

By the early 1960s, the arithmetic would become unsustainable. U.S. gold reserves would decline while foreign dollar holdings grew. The crossover point—when foreign claims exceeded American gold backing—would arrive around 1964. After that, the system survived on confidence alone, not mathematical viability. The question was which country would first call America's bluff.

The answer would come from an unexpected source and for reasons Washington never anticipated: France. When French President Charles de Gaulle stood before television cameras in February 1965 to announce France would begin systematically converting dollar reserves into gold, he set in motion the crisis that would destroy the system. The Triffin dilemma was no longer theoretical—it was about to become catastrophically real.

**The Tragic Irony**

America chose short-term national advantage over long-term systemic stability. The calculation was conscious: White and Morgenthau understood bancor's economic logic but rejected it because American power allowed them to impose American preferences. Twenty-seven years of dollar dominance was worth the eventual crisis.

The result was 27 years of unprecedented growth followed by crisis, collapse, and the perpetuation of Triffin's contradiction into the pure fiat era. When Nixon closed the gold window in August 1971, the dollar standard didn't end—it simply stopped pretending to be constrained by gold. The asymmetries that bancor would have prevented became permanent features of the international monetary system.

We're still living with the choice made in 1944, still debating whether systemic stability or national advantage should guide international monetary architecture. China's dollar trap, European attempts at monetary union, emerging market currency crises, and debates over cryptocurrency alternatives all trace back to the system designed at Bretton Woods when American gold reserves gave the United States overwhelming leverage.

Keynes bet that reason would defeat power. He lost. But he was right about the consequences.

The next chapter examines how the compromise unraveled—how mathematical impossibility transformed into political crisis, how allies became adversaries testing American promises, and how Nixon's "temporary" closure of the gold window became permanent, ending the gold standard forever and inaugurating the age of pure fiat.
