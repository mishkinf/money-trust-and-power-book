# PART IV: THE BREAKING AND BEYOND

## Chapter 11: Bretton Woods and the Dollar's Triumph

**Chapter Premise:** Keynes's bancor lost to White's dollar-centered system. The Triffin dilemma made the compromise unsustainable: the world needed dollar outflows for liquidity, but persistent deficits undermined gold convertibility. Nixon's 1971 closure of the gold window ended the system.

### China's Dollar Trap

In 2024, China holds over $3 trillion in dollar-denominated assets—Treasury bonds, agency securities, corporate debt. It's the world's largest creditor to the United States, financing American consumption and government spending. Yet Chinese officials increasingly worry about this position. The dollar's value depends on American fiscal discipline and Federal Reserve policy—neither of which China controls. If the dollar weakens, China's reserves lose value. If China tries to sell, the resulting crash would destroy the value of its remaining holdings.

This resembles France's 1960s position but operates under fundamentally different constraints. France could test the Bretton Woods system by demanding gold—exposing the material limit of $35/ounce convertibility. China cannot. Under pure fiat, there's no convertibility promise to test, no gold reserves to exhaust. The United States, as a sovereign currency issuer, cannot run out of dollars. What China faces isn't the Triffin dilemma but a different challenge: the political risk of holding assets denominated in another nation's currency. The vulnerability is to American policy decisions and geopolitical power, not to American insolvency.

The 2008 financial crisis revealed both the power and the fragility of this arrangement. When credit markets froze globally, only the Federal Reserve could provide the dollars the world economy needed. The Fed created $580 billion in currency swap lines with foreign central banks—essentially printing dollars for other countries to use. This demonstrated that the dollar's reserve status gives the U.S. extraordinary power: the Fed is the world's central bank by default.

But it also revealed the system's vulnerability. If confidence in the dollar ever truly collapsed, there's no gold to fall back on, no automatic stabilizer. The system works entirely on institutional credibility. Understanding how this system emerged—and why the gold-backed alternative failed—illuminates the constraints and possibilities of our current monetary order.

**This chapter examines Bretton Woods (1944) and its inevitable collapse, tracing how Keynes's bancor—a supranational currency with symmetric adjustment—lost to White's dollar-centered system backed by American gold.** We'll explore the conference's power dynamics (U.S. held 80% of global gold reserves), analyze why the compromise worked for 27 years but contained fatal contradictions, and document the Triffin dilemma: the world needed dollar outflows for liquidity, but persistent deficits undermined gold convertibility. The chapter reveals how de Gaulle's gold offensive, Britain's 1967 crisis, and the London Gold Pool's $3 billion hemorrhage culminated in Nixon's 1971 closure of the gold window—a "temporary" suspension that became permanent, ending the gold standard forever.

### The decisive moment

The turning point came on **July 13, 1944**. A.D. Shroff of the Indian delegation questioned the meaning of "gold and gold-convertible exchange":

> "I think it is high time that the USA delegation give us a definition of gold and gold convertible exchange."

Edward Bernstein of the U.S. delegation replied:

> "Mr Chairman, it might be possible to give a definition...but it would involve a long discussion...it would be easier for this purpose to regard the United States dollar as what was intended when we speak of gold convertible exchange."

Dennis Robertson of the British delegation then proposed the text read: "payment of official gold and subscription should be expressed official holdings of gold and United States dollars."

The irony was profound. It was not the Americans who placed the dollar at the system's center but a fissure within the British Empire—India seeking protection from sterling weakness—and a British economist acknowledging that only the dollar had sufficient strength. The kid who owned the ball would indeed be captain of the team.⁴⁶

### Why bancor failed

White feared Keynes's International Clearing Union could create bancor at will, leaving the United States—the primary creditor—accumulating vast quantities of what he considered worthless paper while exporting real goods. As he wrote in August 1942:

> "There are some who believe that a universally accepted currency not redeemable in gold...is compatible with existence of national sovereignties....A little thought should, however, reveal the impracticability of any such notion."

The New York World-Telegram put it more bluntly in 1943:

> "The kid who owns the ball is usually captain and decides when and where the game will be played...Since the U.S. now owns some twenty-two billions of the world's reported twenty-eight billions of gold, we think Uncle Sam is going to be the captain of the team or there will be no game."

America held the leverage. Britain owed £1.3 billion in sterling balances to India and other colonies—debts that undermined any negotiating position. When Keynes protested an American draft in October 1943—"This is intolerable. It is yet another Talmud. We had better simply break off negotiations"—White replied: "We will try to produce something which Your Highness can understand."⁴⁷

The Americans offered compromises: increasing the Fund size to $8.5 billion, including a "scarce currency clause" allowing rationing of currencies in short supply, permitting some exchange rate flexibility for "fundamental disequilibrium," and creating the World Bank for long-term development finance. But they flatly rejected bancor itself, unlimited credit mechanisms, penalties on surplus countries, and any governance structure that would dilute American control.⁴⁸

Keynes signed the agreement in December 1944, later admitting:

> "We, all of us, had to sign, of course, before we had had a chance of reading through a clean and consecutive copy of the document. All we had seen of it was the dotted line. Our only excuse is the knowledge that our hosts had made final arrangements to throw us out of the hotel, unhouselled, disappointed, unaneled, within a few hours."⁴⁹

Bancor would have cost America its exorbitant privilege. Instead of financing consumption with printed dollars, the U.S. would have faced symmetric adjustment—running surpluses when bancor reserves ran low, just like any other country. The power to sustain persistent deficits, borrow at artificially low rates, and control the reserve currency would disappear. America would lose seigniorage profits, monetary autonomy, strategic leverage through dollar access, and IMF veto power. American negotiators understood this perfectly. White told his delegation the U.S. position was "absolutely no" on surplus country penalties.⁴⁹ᵃ⁻ˡ

**In exchange for:**

- Stable, sustainable international monetary system
- Prevention of the Triffin dilemma
- Reduced risk of future dollar crises
- Long-term systemic benefits for global trade⁴⁹ᵐ

American policymakers chose short-term national advantage. White understood bancor's economic logic but opposed it because his job was advancing American interests, not systemic stability. The question for our era remains: How long can that choice—prioritizing national advantage over system stability—be sustained before the contradictions force change?⁴⁹ⁿ

### The conference: power disguised as negotiation

The Mount Washington Hotel conference (July 1-22, 1944) took place one month after D-Day, with 730 delegates from 44 nations gathering in New Hampshire's White Mountains. The timing was no accident—the Allies were winning the war, and America was determined to win the peace. The conference was scheduled to conclude July 19 but extended three days as delegates argued over details already decided in Washington.⁴⁹ᵃ

The power dynamics were brutally asymmetric. The United States held approximately 22 billion of the world's 28 billion in monetary gold—nearly 80 percent of global reserves. Britain owed £1.3 billion in sterling balances to India and other colonies, debts that undermined any negotiating position. When Keynes attempted to assert British influence, the numbers spoke louder than rhetoric. As the New York World-Telegram noted with characteristic American directness: "The kid who owns the ball is usually captain."⁴⁹ᵇ

Harry Dexter White controlled proceedings with methodical precision. By July 1944, bancor had already been abandoned—not through conference debate but through prior Washington decisions. British delegates arrived to negotiate a system already designed in American interests. When Keynes protested an American draft in October 1943—"This is intolerable. It is yet another Talmud. We had better simply break off negotiations"—White's reply captured the power imbalance perfectly: "We will try to produce something which Your Highness can understand."⁴⁹ᶜ

The Americans offered tactical compromises to create the appearance of negotiation. The Fund size increased from initial proposals to $8.5 billion. A "scarce currency clause" allowed rationing of currencies in short supply—theoretically applicable to dollars but never actually used. Exchange rates could adjust for "fundamental disequilibrium"—vague enough to mean anything or nothing. The World Bank was created for long-term development finance, sweetening the package for debtor nations.⁴⁹ᵈ

But on core issues, American positions were non-negotiable: no bancor (only dollars as reserve currency), no unlimited credit mechanisms (only limited IMF quotas), no penalties on surplus countries (only pressure on deficit countries), no governance structure diluting American control (voting weighted by economic size, ensuring US veto power). These weren't negotiating positions—they were fait accompli disguised as proposals.⁴⁹ᵉ

Why was Keynes's plan superior yet politically impossible? The International Clearing Union with bancor offered several advantages: **symmetrical adjustment** (pressure on both surplus and deficit countries, preventing creditor hoarding), **automatic liquidity** (no country could face dollar shortage when bancor was created for trade needs), **no reserve currency privilege** (no single nation gained "exorbitant privilege"), and **supranational governance** (decisions made by international authority, not dominant nation).⁴⁹ᶠ

The problem was precisely these advantages. Symmetrical adjustment meant the United States—the primary surplus country—would face penalties for accumulating credits. Automatic liquidity meant America couldn't control when and how international money was created. No reserve currency privilege meant America sacrificed seigniorage profits and monetary autonomy. Supranational governance meant surrendering control to an institution where American interests wouldn't automatically prevail.⁴⁹ᵍ

From America's perspective, Keynes was asking the creditor to finance a system where debtors could create unlimited claims on creditor resources. As White wrote in August 1942, a "universally accepted currency not redeemable in gold" seemed "incompatible with existence of national sovereignties"—meaning incompatible with American sovereignty specifically. Why would the United States, holding 80 percent of monetary gold and emerging as the world's dominant economy, agree to a system that constrained American power?⁴⁹ʰ

The conference atmosphere reflected these tensions. Keynes, the celebrity economist whose 1919 Economic Consequences of the Peace had predicted Versailles Treaty disaster and whose General Theory had reshaped economics, arrived as something of a rock star. But celebrity meant nothing without gold reserves and military power. White, the less famous but more powerful Treasury official, controlled the proceedings. Documents were prepared in advance, voting procedures favored American positions, and the schedule ensured exhausted delegates would sign rather than continue arguing.⁴⁹ⁱ

Keynes's December 1944 admission—signing before reading "a clean and consecutive copy," seeing only "the dotted line," excusing themselves because "hosts had made final arrangements to throw us out of the hotel"—captures the coercion disguised as cooperation. This was not negotiation between equals but capitulation by the weak to terms set by the strong. The Bretton Woods "agreement" was American monetary architecture accepted by nations with no alternative.⁴⁹ʲ

Lionel Robbins, Head of the Economic Section of the War Cabinet, confessed in his diary to Fred Vinson: **"We know we will be beaten and we hope to avoid being humiliated."**⁴⁹ʲ⁻¹ Britain experienced both. On July 19, Keynes collapsed from a heart attack. Robbins wrote: **"I now feel that it is a race between the exhaustion of his powers and the termination of the conference."**⁴⁹ʲ⁻⁴ Morgenthau threatened to seize the hotel and force delegates out. Under this pressure, they signed documents they hadn't read. **"I went to Savannah to meet the world," Keynes said later, "and all I met was a tyrant."**⁴⁹ʲ⁻¹⁰ He died in April 1946, aged 62. Robbins's diary documents how American power, not economic merit, established the dollar standard.

### Tale of Two Systems: Bancor vs. Dollar Standard

The Bretton Woods conference presented a choice between two fundamentally different monetary architectures. Understanding what was rejected illuminates why what was accepted eventually failed.⁴⁹ᵏ

**Think of it like choosing between two ways to organize neighborhood trade:**

**Keynes's bancor** = A community credit system where everyone tracks debts in "neighborhood points." No one needs actual dollars. If you mow lawns, you get 10 points. When you need groceries, you spend 10 points. The system automatically balances—anyone accumulating too many points gets charged storage fees, encouraging them to spend. No one can hoard, no one gets special privileges, and the neighborhood never runs out of "money" because points are created as needed for trade.

**White's dollar standard** = Everyone must trade using actual U.S. dollars owned by your wealthy neighbor Bob. To trade with each other, you all need Bob's dollars. Bob lends them out, but eventually you owe Bob interest. If Bob stops lending or demands payment, the whole neighborhood's trade freezes. Bob accumulates wealth from interest payments while everyone else competes for his dollars. Bob gets special treatment because he owns the currency you all must use.

The choice was between a neutral system (bancor) and one privileging American power (dollars). America chose its own advantage.⁴⁹ᵏ⁻¹

#### Keynes's International Clearing Union (Bancor System)

**Currency:**

- Supranational bancor (from "banque or"—bank gold)
- Defined in gold but **NOT exchangeable for gold**
- No single nation's currency privileged
- All international trade valued and cleared in bancor⁴⁹ˡ

**Liquidity Provision:**

- Unlimited overdraft facilities based on trade quotas
- Quotas proportionate to trade volume
- Automatic expansion as world trade grows
- No country faces currency shortage
- International Clearing Union functions as central bank for central banks⁴⁹ᵐ

**Adjustment Mechanism:**

- **SYMMETRIC**: Pressure on both surplus AND deficit countries
- Surplus countries charged 5-10% interest on large excess credits
- Persistent surpluses trigger mandatory currency appreciation
- "Use it or lose it" mechanism prevents creditor hoarding
- Both sides bear responsibility for correcting imbalances⁴⁹ⁿ

**Governance:**

- International Clearing Union with supranational authority
- Decisions made by international board
- No single country veto power
- Democratic international institution⁴⁹ᵒ

**The Triffin Dilemma:**

- **SOLVED**: No single currency needed for reserves
- Bancor created as needed for trade settlement
- No country must run deficits to supply world liquidity
- Structural contradiction eliminated by design⁴⁹ᵖ

---

#### White's Stabilization Fund (Dollar Standard)

**Currency:**

- U.S. dollar as primary reserve currency
- Dollar convertible to gold at $35/ounce
- **FOR OFFICIAL HOLDERS ONLY** (foreign central banks and governments, not private citizens)
- Dollar privileged as "good as gold"
- National currencies used, not supranational money⁴⁹ᵍ

**Liquidity Provision:**

- Limited IMF resources ($8.5 billion initial quota)
- Finite pool, not automatic expansion
- Countries can exhaust IMF borrowing capacity
- Dollar shortages possible and inevitable
- Subscriptions and quotas system, not clearing union⁴⁹ʳ

**Adjustment Mechanism:**

- **ASYMMETRIC**: Pressure only on deficit countries
- Surplus countries face no penalties or interest charges
- No requirement to appreciate currency or reduce surpluses
- "Beggar thy neighbor" policies possible for surplus nations
- White to American delegation: "We have been perfectly adamant on that point. We have taken the position of absolutely no, on that."⁴⁹ˢ

**Governance:**

- IMF voting weighted by quota contributions
- U.S. contributes most, therefore effective veto power
- Washington location ensures American influence
- American interests control major decisions⁴⁹ᵗ

**The Triffin Dilemma:**

- **CREATED**: World needs dollars for trade and reserves
- U.S. must run balance-of-payments deficits to supply dollars
- Persistent deficits undermine gold convertibility promise
- **STRUCTURAL CONTRADICTION** built into system design⁴⁹ᵘ

---

#### Why Keynes's System Was Superior

From pure economic design perspective, bancor solved problems the dollar standard created:

1. **Prevented the Triffin dilemma** before it emerged—no reserve currency paradox when using supranational money
2. **Symmetric adjustment** prevented persistent imbalances (like China's modern surpluses or interwar French gold hoarding)
3. **Unlimited liquidity** matched automatically to actual trade needs, preventing deflationary dollar shortages
4. **No "exorbitant privilege"** for any single nation—all countries operated under same rules⁴⁹ᵛ

The system's economic logic was impeccable. White couldn't refute it on economic grounds. He opposed it on **political grounds**: it asked America to surrender advantages.⁴⁹ʷ

#### Why America Chose Dollar Standard Anyway

The choice wasn't about economic optimality. It was about power. White's plan preserved:

- **Seigniorage profits**: America earns interest on dollars held abroad as reserves while creating them costlessly
- **Monetary autonomy**: U.S. sets policy independently; other countries must adjust to American decisions
- **Political leverage**: Dollar access becomes strategic weapon (modern sanctions demonstrate this)
- **Veto power**: American control over IMF prevents decisions contrary to U.S. interests⁴⁹ˣ

White understood perfectly well that bancor was economically superior for the **system**. But his job was advancing **American** interests, not systemic stability. As he told the American delegation in July 1944: "Gold in Fort Knox is why the United States is in an enviable position...why we are in a powerful position in this Conference...why we dominate practically the financial world, because we have the where-with-all to buy any currency we want."⁴⁹ʸ

**The tragic irony:** America chose short-term national advantage over long-term systemic stability. The result was 27 years of growth followed by crisis, collapse, and the perpetuation of Triffin's contradiction into the pure fiat era. We're still living with the choice made in 1944.⁴⁹ᶻ

### The system in practice

The Bretton Woods system that emerged was not truly a gold standard but a **dollar standard** with gold as window dressing. The critical asymmetry: only foreign central banks and governments could convert dollars to gold at $35 per ounce—not private parties. This "**exorbitant privilege**," as French Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d'Estaing would later call it, was the system's foundation.⁵⁰

Think of it this way: imagine you could pay your mortgage by writing IOUs in "Steve-Dollars" that your bank must accept, but your bank can't pay its obligations in Steve-Dollars—it must get real dollars from someone else. That asymmetry is America's exorbitant privilege. The US can print dollars to pay debts; everyone else must earn or borrow dollars they cannot create.

The mechanics worked smoothly at first. Countries maintained fixed exchange rates by buying or selling dollars. When imbalances emerged, the IMF provided short-term liquidity. When "fundamental disequilibrium" occurred, countries could devalue. But devaluation was never painless—as Britain discovered in November 1967.⁵¹

### Britain's 1967 crisis: when the pound broke

On **Saturday, November 18, 1967, at 9:30 PM**, Chancellor of the Exchequer James Callaghan appeared on television to announce that the pound would be devalued from **$2.80 to $2.40**—a **14.3 percent reduction**. The announcement came on a weekend to minimize market disruption, but the crisis had been building for months.⁵¹ᵃ

Britain's problem was structural. The Labour government had inherited an **£800 million balance-of-payments deficit** when it took office in 1964. Worse, **£4.5 billion in overseas sterling balances**—debts to Commonwealth countries and former colonies holding pounds as reserves—created permanent vulnerability. Every time confidence wavered, holders could convert sterling to dollars, draining Britain's reserves. The pound was overvalued at $2.80, making exports uncompetitive, but devaluation would anger sterling holders and undermine London's role as a financial center.⁵¹ᵇ

Wilson's government tried everything to avoid devaluation. They imposed austerity budgets, raised interest rates, negotiated **IMF standby credits**, and implemented a six-month wage and price freeze in July 1966. The Bank of England intervened repeatedly to defend the parity, spending reserves to buy pounds whenever the rate weakened. For three years, Wilson insisted devaluation was unthinkable—**"the pound in your pocket"** would not be affected.⁵¹ᶜ

But on **September 7, 1967**, a seemingly minor dock strike at Liverpool escalated into a nationwide port shutdown. Exports stalled. The trade deficit widened. Speculators sensed weakness and began selling sterling. By early November, reserves were hemorrhaging. The Bank of England lost **$1.5 billion in a matter of weeks**. The dam broke. On November 16, the Cabinet met in emergency session and voted to devalue.⁵¹ᵈ

Callaghan's Saturday evening broadcast was somber: "From now on the pound abroad is worth 14 percent or so less in terms of other currencies." The next day, Prime Minister Wilson addressed the nation, attempting damage control with what became the crisis's most infamous line: **"It does not mean, of course, that the pound here in Britain, in your pocket or purse or in your bank, has been devalued."** Technically true—domestic prices hadn't changed instantly—but widely mocked as duplicitous. Devaluation would soon drive import prices higher, eroding purchasing power exactly as Wilson denied.⁵¹ᵉ

The **IMF imposed harsh conditions** for its **£1.4 billion rescue loan** (approved November 29, 1967): **£500 million in spending cuts, higher interest rates, and strict monetary targets**. Callaghan resigned as Chancellor three days later, switching positions with Home Secretary Roy Jenkins. The crisis marked a humiliating retreat from Britain's postwar pretensions to great power status. Sterling, once the world's dominant reserve currency, was now a liability requiring international support.⁵¹ᶠ

The devaluation revealed the Bretton Woods system's inherent tensions. Britain couldn't maintain full employment, stable prices, and a fixed exchange rate simultaneously—the **impossible trinity** of open-economy macroeconomics. **Capital controls** had delayed the reckoning, but once speculators sensed vulnerability, no amount of intervention could hold the line. The pound's crisis foreshadowed the dollar's larger crisis to come. If Britain—America's closest ally, with extensive capital controls and IMF support—couldn't maintain its parity, how long could the United States defend $35 gold with mounting deficits and dwindling reserves?⁵¹ᵍ

### What 1967 Revealed About the System

Britain's 1967 devaluation was more than a national humiliation—it was a preview of the dollar crisis to come, revealing three fundamental truths about Bretton Woods' fragility.⁵¹ʰ

**Revelation 1: Capital Controls Couldn't Hold**

Britain maintained extensive capital controls throughout the 1960s—restrictions on moving money across borders—specifically designed to prevent speculative attacks. These included limits on foreign investment, restrictions on currency exchanges, and regulations requiring Bank of England approval for large transactions. The controls were among the most comprehensive in the developed world.⁵¹ⁱ

Yet speculators still drained **$1.5 billion in reserves in weeks** during the September-November 1967 crisis. The mechanism: speculators didn't need to move capital out of Britain directly. They simply delayed payments in sterling while accelerating payments in other currencies, sold sterling forward in anticipation of devaluation, and used offshore markets (eurodollar market) that operated beyond British regulatory reach.⁵¹ʲ

If capital controls couldn't protect Britain—with IMF support, American alliance, and sterling area preferences—what chance did fixed exchange rates have in an era of growing capital mobility? The 1960s saw telecommunications improvements and financial innovation that made capital controls increasingly porous. Technology was rendering 1940s-era restrictions obsolete.⁵¹ᵏ

**Revelation 2: IMF Conditions Meant Austerity**

The IMF's £1.4 billion rescue loan (approved November 29, 1967) came with harsh conditions that demonstrated what "international support" actually meant:

- **£500 million in spending cuts** (roughly 2% of GDP)
- **Higher interest rates** to attract capital and defend the new parity, dampening economic growth
- **Strict monetary targets** limiting Bank of England discretion
- **Wage restraint policies** requiring workers to bear adjustment costs⁵¹ˡ

The economic impact was severe. British GDP growth slowed markedly in 1968. Unemployment rose as fiscal austerity contracted demand. The pattern: fixed exchange rates meant deflation and unemployment when deficits emerged. The alternative (devaluation) meant IMF conditionality and austerity. Either way, workers paid the cost of maintaining currency credibility while bondholders' interests were protected.⁵¹ᵐ

This prefigured modern IMF crisis management—from Latin America in the 1980s to Greece in 2010s. The institutional logic remained constant: protect creditors, impose austerity on workers, frame adjustment as technical necessity rather than political choice.⁵¹ⁿ

**Revelation 3: The Impossible Trinity**

Britain's crisis demonstrated what economists call the "impossible trinity" (or "trilemma") of international finance with brutal clarity:⁵¹ᵒ

A country can have any **TWO** of the following, but not all **THREE**:
1. Fixed exchange rate
2. Independent monetary policy  
3. Free capital flows

Britain tried to have:
- **Fixed rate** ($2.80/£1 since 1949)
- **Capital controls** (restricting #3 to preserve #1 and #2)
- **Independent policy** (pursuing full employment domestically)⁵¹ᵖ

Even giving up capital mobility wasn't enough. The trilemma proved inescapable. Once speculators attacked, Britain lost monetary policy independence anyway—forced to raise interest rates to defend the pound, sacrificing domestic employment for currency stability. The government couldn't pursue both full employment AND fixed exchange rate, even with capital controls.⁵¹ᵍ

**What This Meant for the Dollar:**

If Britain—America's closest ally, with capital controls and IMF support—couldn't maintain its parity against speculative pressure, how could the United States defend $35 gold convertibility with mounting deficits and dwindling reserves?

Foreign central banks watching London's collapse drew the obvious lesson: **Fixed parities are political promises that break under pressure**. Sterling had been "good as gold" for centuries, the dominant reserve currency of the 19th century, backed by the British Empire's might. Then in one Saturday evening broadcast, it lost 14.3% of its value. If sterling could fall, the dollar's promise looked equally fragile.⁵¹ʳ

This is why de Gaulle accelerated French gold conversions after November 1967. This is why the London Gold Pool collapsed just four months later (March 1968), hemorrhaging $3 billion as speculators tested the $35/ounce official price. Sterling's fall foreshadowed dollar's breaking. The system's credibility eroded not in a single crisis but through demonstration that promises could not be kept.⁵¹ˢ

The only question was timing: when, not if, would someone force America to choose between honoring convertibility (exhausting gold reserves) and preserving reserves (closing the gold window). Britain's crisis in 1967 made that choice inevitable within four years.⁵¹ᵗ

The system facilitated postwar reconstruction and enabled unprecedented trade expansion. For 25 years (1946-1971), Bretton Woods delivered remarkable results: stable exchange rates provided certainty for international trade, global GDP grew at unprecedented rates, international trade expanded faster than at any prior period, and inflation remained moderate across most developed economies. The "Golden Age of Capitalism" rested on the foundation of the dollar-gold system.⁵²ᵃ

### The success years: 1946-1971

The Bretton Woods era represents one of the most successful periods in modern economic history. Between 1950 and 1973, global GDP grew at an average annual rate of 4.9 percent—significantly higher than the 3.0 percent average from 1973-1998 or the 1.3 percent average during the interwar gold standard period (1919-1939). The United States, Western Europe, and Japan all experienced rapid reconstruction and growth.⁵²ᵇ

International trade expanded even faster than GDP. World exports grew at 8.2 percent annually from 1950-1973, compared to just 1.3 percent from 1913-1950 and 5.2 percent from 1973-1998. The system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates provided certainty for traders while allowing periodic realignments when imbalances became unsustainable. Major devaluations occurred (Britain 1949 and 1967, France 1958 and 1969), but these were managed through IMF coordination rather than competitive devaluation spirals that had plagued the 1930s.⁵²ᶜ

Capital controls—restrictions on cross-border money movements—played a crucial but underappreciated role. Bretton Woods explicitly permitted and even encouraged countries to restrict capital flows while maintaining current account convertibility (the ability to exchange currency for trade purposes). This allowed governments to pursue full employment policies without fearing capital flight. Britain maintained extensive capital controls through the 1960s; France restricted capital movements until the 1980s. The system prioritized productive trade over speculative finance—a sharp contrast to the pre-1914 classical gold standard's commitment to free capital mobility.⁵²ᵈ

The IMF provided stabilization loans when countries faced temporary balance-of-payments difficulties, offering an alternative to immediate deflationary adjustment. When Britain faced a payments crisis in 1961, the IMF assembled a $2 billion support package. When Italy experienced capital flight in 1964, IMF credit prevented forced devaluation. This "managed flexibility" prevented the rigid deflation the gold standard had imposed while maintaining exchange rate stability.⁵²ᵉ

Why did it work so well for so long? Three factors: **American dominance** (U.S. held overwhelming gold reserves and productive capacity in 1945, making dollar confidence initially justified), **capital controls** (restricted speculative flows that might test convertibility), and **limited international finance** (most transactions were trade-related, not capital movements). As these conditions eroded—U.S. gold reserves declined, capital controls weakened, international finance expanded—the system's contradictions became unsustainable.⁵²ᶠ

But it contained a fatal flaw that economist Robert Triffin had identified in his 1959-60 Congressional testimony: once "outstanding dollar liabilities to the rest of the world would eventually exceed the US monetary gold stock," a "classic bank run" would occur.⁵²ᵍ

### Understanding International Payments: A Brief Primer

Before examining the Triffin dilemma, we need to understand how money flows between countries—concepts that seem technical but determine whether monetary systems succeed or fail.

When countries trade, they track two accounts. The **current account** records trade in goods and services: exports (money flowing in) minus imports (money flowing out). If you export more than you import, you run a **surplus**—more money coming in than going out. If you import more than you export, you run a **deficit**—more money going out than coming in.

The **balance of payments** is the full accounting, including not just trade but also financial flows: investments, loans, and reserve holdings. When the U.S. runs a current account deficit (importing more than exporting), dollars flow abroad. Foreign holders can either: (1) buy American goods/services (closing the deficit), (2) invest in American assets (stocks, bonds, real estate), or (3) hold dollars as reserves (for their own currency backing or trade settlement).

Under Bretton Woods, these dollar outflows created the global money supply. When America imported French wine, dollars flowed to France. The French could convert those dollars to gold at $35 per ounce (official convertibility) or hold them as reserves (backing francs). Most chose reserves—more convenient than gold, still convertible if needed.

This worked beautifully at first. But as dollar outflows accumulated year after year, foreign dollar holdings eventually exceeded American gold reserves. At that point, if every foreign central bank demanded gold simultaneously, America couldn't honor the $35 promise. The system rested on confidence that most holders wouldn't convert—a confidence that proved fragile.

This is the foundation for understanding the Triffin dilemma: the world needed dollar outflows for liquidity, but those same outflows undermined the gold convertibility that gave dollars credibility.

---

### The Triffin Dilemma: The Impossible Math

Robert Triffin's 1959-60 Congressional testimony identified a structural contradiction that made Bretton Woods' collapse inevitable. The dilemma wasn't a policy mistake that could be corrected—it was **mathematical impossibility** built into the system's architecture.⁵³

**The Simple Version:**

The world needed dollars for two purposes:
1. **Transaction demand**: Settling international trade
2. **Reserve demand**: Central banks holding dollars as backing for their currencies

Both required the U.S. to run balance-of-payments deficits (exporting more dollars than importing). But the dollar's gold convertibility depended on deficits remaining small enough that gold reserves could cover dollar liabilities. These requirements contradicted each other.⁵³ᵃ

**The Triffin dilemma is like being the designated driver at a party where your car is also the only transportation home.** Everyone needs you to stay sober (maintain currency credibility through gold convertibility) so you can drive them home safely. But they also keep pressuring you to drink (run deficits to provide liquidity) because the party can't continue without you participating. Eventually, you either:

1. **Stay sober** and everyone complains the party is dying (liquidity shortage causing global deflation), or
2. **Drink to keep the party going** and eventually can't drive anyone home safely (dollar convertibility collapses)

The United States faced exactly this: the world needed dollar outflows (U.S. deficits) for trade and reserves, but persistent deficits eventually undermined confidence in dollar-gold convertibility. Nixon's 1971 decision to close the gold window was like the designated driver finally saying, "Find another way home—I'm done being stuck in this impossible position."

**The Math That Doesn't Work:**

The actual numbers prove the impossibility. Triffin predicted in 1959-60 that once "outstanding dollar liabilities to the rest of the world would eventually exceed the US monetary gold stock," a "classic bank run" would occur. Here's how it played out:⁵³ᵇ

**1949-50:** U.S. gold reserves peaked at **$24.6 billion** with modest foreign dollar liabilities—system appeared sustainable.⁵³ᶜ As world trade expanded, dollar demand grew exponentially, but gold mining couldn't keep pace.⁵³ᵈ

**1962:** Liabilities to foreign **official holders** (who could convert at $35/ounce) exceeded gold reserves—convertibility became fiction.⁵³ᵉ⁻ᶠ

**1966:** Gold reserves **$13.2 billion**, central bank dollar holdings **$14 billion**—only 94% backing. America couldn't honor all conversion requests simultaneously.⁵³ᵍ⁻ʰ

**March 1968:** Reserves crashed to **$10.7 billion** after London Gold Pool lost $3 billion. Two-tier market created—implicit admission $35/ounce unsustainable.⁵³ⁱ

**August 15, 1971:** Reserves **$10 billion**, liabilities **$80 billion**—only **12.5% backing**. Four days earlier, Britain's $3 billion conversion request proved "the game was indeed over" (Volcker).⁵³ʲ

**Why This Was STRUCTURALLY Unsolvable:**

The Triffin dilemma presented four options, **none of which worked**:⁵³ᵏ

**Option A: Stop Running Deficits**
- Result: Dollar shortage globally
- Effect: Deflation, trade collapse, depression
- Historical precedent: 1930s gold hoarding created exactly this scenario
- Countries would compete for scarce dollars, triggering "beggar thy neighbor" policies
- **Politically impossible**—would trigger global recession⁵³ˡ

**Option B: Keep Running Deficits**
- Result: Dollar liabilities eventually exceed gold reserves (which happened)
- Effect: Convertibility becomes unsustainable fiction
- Outcome: Eventually someone calls the bluff (France did, then Britain)
- **Mathematically impossible**—gold reserves can't grow as fast as trade⁵³ᵐ

**Option C: Increase Gold Reserves**
- Problem: Gold mining far too slow
- Annual gold production: ~40-50 million ounces globally in 1960s
- U.S. share: Much less
- Can't grow reserves fast enough to match 8%+ annual trade growth
- **Arithmetically impossible**—mining can't keep pace with commerce⁵³ⁿ

**Option D: Devalue Dollar (Raise Gold Price)**
- Problem: Destroys confidence, triggers immediate conversion rush
- Every holder would rush to convert before next devaluation
- Expectations of further devaluation become self-fulfilling
- Accelerates crisis rather than solving it
- **Psychologically impossible**—devaluation triggers the bank run it's meant to prevent⁵³ᵒ

**The Proof:**

Triffin didn't predict what **might** happen. He provided mathematical proof that the system **MUST** collapse. The only question was timing—when would someone test the promise?

France tested it systematically (1965-1968), converting $2.8 billion of the total $3.3 billion decline in U.S. gold stocks—85% of American gold losses. Spain converted $60 million. Then Britain requested $3 billion on August 11, 1971. The system broke because it was designed with an internal contradiction. Triffin showed this in 1959. Nixon confirmed it in 1971.⁵³ᵖ

**Why the Fiat Era Is Different:**

The Triffin dilemma was specific to commodity-backed reserve currency systems. Post-1971, the dynamics changed fundamentally:

**No solvency constraint**: A sovereign currency issuer cannot run out of its own currency. The U.S. can always create dollars to meet obligations denominated in dollars—this is the core Modern Monetary Theory principle. Under Bretton Woods, the U.S. could run out of gold at $35/ounce. Under fiat, it cannot run out of dollars.⁵³ᵍ

**Structural dollar demand**: Global commodities (oil, copper, wheat) are priced in dollars. International trade contracts are denominated in dollars. This creates inherent, persistent demand for dollar reserves—independent of any commodity backing. When China buys oil from Saudi Arabia, both parties need dollars for the transaction, creating continuous demand regardless of US fiscal policy.

**Different risks**: The fiat system faces inflation risk if money creation exceeds productive capacity, political pressure to use monetary policy for narrow interests, and coordination challenges in a multipolar world. But these are fundamentally different from the Triffin dilemma's mathematical impossibility of supplying global liquidity while maintaining gold convertibility.

China's accumulation of dollar assets creates **political vulnerability** (exposure to Fed policy decisions, potential sanctions, exchange rate fluctuations) but not a replay of France's 1960s position. There's no material constraint to test, no convertibility promise that can break like the $35/ounce peg. The question isn't whether America can supply dollars—it always can—but whether institutions manage monetary policy to maintain dollar credibility without commodity backing. That's the fiat era's challenge: political discipline, not material limits.⁵³ʳ

### De Gaulle's gold offensive: converting doubt into bullion

The abstract dilemma became concrete crisis when countries began testing American promises. The most aggressive challenger was France under **President Charles de Gaulle**, who viewed dollar dominance as American imperialism by monetary means.⁵³ᵃ

On **February 4, 1965**, de Gaulle held a press conference that sent shockwaves through the Bretton Woods system. He announced France would begin converting substantial dollar reserves into gold, declaring: **"We consider it necessary that international trade be established on an indisputable monetary base that does not bear the stamp of any particular country."** The barely-veiled critique was clear—the dollar's reserve status gave America "exorbitant privilege" to finance deficits by printing money the world was forced to accept.⁵³ᵇ

France backed words with action. Between **1962 and 1966**, France reduced its dollar reserves and accumulated gold aggressively. French conversions alone accounted for **$2.8 billion of the $3.3 billion total decline in U.S. gold stocks** during this period—an astonishing 85 percent of American gold losses. Ships carrying gold bars sailed regularly from the **Federal Reserve Bank of New York to the Banque de France** in Paris. Each shipment represented a vote of no confidence in the dollar's future.⁵³ᶜ

The French weren't alone. **Spain**, under Franco's government, exchanged **$60 million for gold** in 1964-65—described as "the biggest transaction of the Franco era." Even this relatively modest sum mattered because it demonstrated that countries across the political spectrum—from Gaullist France to Francoist Spain—were questioning dollar credibility.⁵³ᵈ

The conversions created a vicious cycle. Each country that converted dollars to gold had rational self-interest: get gold while reserves lasted. But collective action accelerated the crisis. As reserves dwindled, remaining dollar holders grew more nervous, increasing conversion pressure. The classic bank run dynamic—first out survives, last out loses—applied to sovereign central banks just as to retail depositors.⁵³ᵉ

America couldn't simply refuse conversion without destroying the system's foundation. **The entire Bretton Woods architecture rested on the promise that dollars were "as good as gold"** because foreign official holders could convert them at $35 per ounce. Refusing conversion would prove the promise was empty, triggering immediate collapse. But honoring every conversion request would exhaust gold reserves, also triggering collapse. The U.S. was trapped.⁵³ᶠ

The most dramatic test came **four days before Nixon closed the gold window**. On **August 11, 1971**, the British government—America's closest ally—requested conversion of **$3 billion in dollar reserves** to gold. Paul Volcker, then Under Secretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs, later recalled the moment's significance: **"If the British…were going to take gold for their dollars, it was clear the game was indeed over."**⁵³ᵍ

Britain's request was particularly devastating because it came from a country deeply invested in the system's survival. If even Britain—with its "special relationship" to America, its dependence on Atlantic alliance, its own interest in reserve currency stability—was converting dollars to gold, no trust remained. The request demonstrated that when push came to shove, even allies prioritized their own reserves over systemic stability.⁵³ᵐ

The parallel to China's modern dollar trap is exact. In the 1960s, France and Britain accumulated dollars through trade surpluses and found themselves holding depreciating assets they couldn't sell without crashing the market. Today, China holds over $3 trillion in dollar-denominated assets with the same dilemma: converting too quickly would destroy the value of remaining holdings, but holding dollars means vulnerability to American policy. De Gaulle tried to escape the trap by demanding gold. China has no such option—the gold window is closed. The trap is now permanent.⁵³ˡ

### The London Gold Pool: holding back the tide

The crisis came in waves. In November 1961, eight central banks formed the **London Gold Pool**, contributing 240 metric tons ($270 million) to defend the $35 per ounce price. The United States contributed 50 percent ($135 million); seven European central banks split the remainder. The Bank of England executed all transactions, selling gold when the London price approached $35.20 and buying when it weakened below $35.08.⁵⁴

For four years, the Pool worked. Between 1962 and 1965, it accumulated a cumulative surplus of $1.4 billion in purchases—the Pool was actually making money. But from 1965 to March 1968, it suffered a cumulative deficit of $3.7 billion. France withdrew in June 1967; the U.S. share rose from 50 to 60 percent. Between November 1967 and March 1968, the Pool lost nearly $3 billion in five months.⁵⁵

On March 14-15, 1968, the crisis reached its peak. The Queen declared a bank holiday to close the London gold market. On March 16-17, central bankers met in emergency session in Washington. The London Gold Pool was disbanded. In its place emerged the **two-tier gold market**: an official tier where central banks traded at $35 per ounce, and a private tier where market forces determined the price. When the private market reopened on April 1, 1968, gold traded at $38 per ounce—an 8 percent premium. By May 21, it had reached $42.60.⁵⁶

The two-tier system was a tacit admission that the Bretton Woods gold price was unsustainable. Central banks agreed to trade gold only at $35 per ounce among themselves, to supply no gold to private markets from official stocks, and to buy little or no gold from private sellers. The system limped along for three more years, but the end was inevitable.⁵⁷

### The Nixon Shock

By the late 1960s, the contradiction was unsustainable. The Vietnam War and Great Society programs had created large U.S. deficits. Dollars accumulated in foreign central banks, far exceeding U.S. gold reserves. France had been aggressively converting dollars to gold since de Gaulle's February 4, 1965 press conference—between 1962 and 1966, France reduced its dollar reserves by $2.8 billion, accounting for most of the $3.3 billion decline in U.S. gold stocks. Spain exchanged $60 million for gold in 1964-65, the "biggest transaction of the Franco era." The test came on **August 11, 1971**, when Britain requested a $3 billion gold transfer. Paul Volcker, then Under Secretary of the Treasury, later recalled: "If the British...were going to take gold for their dollars, it was clear the game was indeed over."⁵⁸

Four days later, on August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon appeared on television to announce that the United States would "temporarily" suspend dollar convertibility to gold. The announcement was a shock—no warning had been given to foreign governments or even to most U.S. officials. But it was also inevitable. The U.S. simply did not have enough gold to redeem all outstanding dollar claims.⁵⁹

The suspension was announced as temporary. It became permanent. By 1973, the Bretton Woods system had collapsed entirely. Major currencies began floating against each other, their values determined by market forces rather than fixed parities. For the first time in history, the world's monetary system was based entirely on **fiat currency**—money backed by nothing but government decree and public confidence.⁶⁰

The gold standard, which had dominated monetary thinking for two centuries, was dead. And remarkably, the world did not collapse. Inflation rose in the 1970s, but it was eventually controlled. Trade continued to expand. Financial markets adapted to floating exchange rates. The lesson was clear: **gold had never been necessary**. What mattered was institutional credibility, fiscal capacity, and the ability to manage monetary policy. These were human creations, not natural laws.⁶¹

### The liberation from gold

From the Bank Restriction Act of 1797 to the Nixon Shock of 1971, the story of money's evolution was a story of **institutional learning**. Each crisis revealed the same truth: gold was not the foundation of monetary value; institutions were. And institutions could function without gold—if they maintained operational capacity, if government could tax effectively and mobilize real resources, if monetary and fiscal policy coordinated to manage productive capacity rather than arbitrary monetary aggregates.⁵²

The breaking of the gold standard was not a failure but a **liberation**. It freed governments to pursue full employment, to respond to economic crises without being constrained by arbitrary metal reserves, to recognize that money was a tool for human purposes rather than a natural phenomenon to be worshipped. The transition was painful and often mismanaged. But it was necessary.⁵³

What remained was the challenge that had always existed: how to maintain money's function when it was no longer backed by commodity reserves. The answer, as Britain had discovered in 1797 and America rediscovered in 1971, lay in **institutions**—in central banks that coordinated with fiscal policy to manage real resource constraints, in governments that could tax effectively to create currency demand and mobilize productive capacity, in legal frameworks that maintained the social contract. Money was a social technology, and like all technologies, it worked when institutions served public purposes rather than arbitrary constraints.⁵⁴

The gold standard had been an accident, created by Newton's mathematics and sustained by British power. Its collapse was equally accidental, driven by war, depression, and the contradictions inherent in trying to base a growing global economy on a fixed supply of metal. What emerged from the wreckage was something more honest: money as a **human institution**, created by law and sustained by trust, serving the needs of the economy rather than constraining it. The breaking was complete. The age of fiat had begun.⁵⁵

The age of pure fiat had begun, but its architecture was still being built. How would central banks manage money creation to match productive capacity? How would governments mobilize real resources without artificial financial constraints? How would international coordination work without fixed exchange rates? These questions would shape the next half-century, as the world learned to operate a monetary system recognizing that real resources, not money itself, were the true constraint. The answers would emerge through crisis and experimentation, revealing both the flexibility and the political challenges of money freed from commodity backing.

The dollar's reserve currency status creates ongoing challenges, but these are fundamentally different from the Triffin dilemma. Under Bretton Woods, the contradiction was mathematical: global liquidity needs grew exponentially while gold reserves were fixed. Supply and convertibility were materially incompatible—a zero-sum game where every dollar supplied abroad weakened the gold backing.

Under fiat, the constraint is political and institutional, not material. The Federal Reserve can supply whatever dollar liquidity the world economy needs—as demonstrated in 2008 when it created $580 billion in currency swap lines overnight, and again in 2020 when it provided unlimited dollar liquidity during the COVID crisis. The U.S. cannot run out of dollars the way it ran out of gold. The question is whether the Fed manages this power to maintain price stability and institutional credibility while serving global needs.

This is why understanding the gold standard's history matters: it reveals that current debates about "dollar sustainability" often use outdated gold-standard framing. When commentators worry about U.S. deficits "undermining the dollar" as if repeating the 1960s crisis, they're applying Bretton Woods logic to a fundamentally different system. The challenge isn't material exhaustion but managing fiat flexibility responsibly—controlling inflation, maintaining fiscal capacity, preserving institutional trust, and navigating the geopolitical tensions that arise when one nation's currency serves as global reserve. These are political and institutional challenges, not Triffin's mathematical impossibility.

Understanding Bretton Woods' collapse reveals that our current monetary arrangements are choices, not natural laws. Nixon's decision to close the gold window was presented as temporary but became permanent because the alternative—deflation to defend gold convertibility—was politically unacceptable. The lesson: when monetary rules conflict with economic reality, the rules get changed. This applies to modern debates about central bank independence, inflation targeting, and fiscal rules. These are institutional choices that can be modified when they stop serving human needs.

The gold standard died because it constrained economic growth and employment. If current monetary arrangements create similar problems—persistent unemployment, financial instability, climate inaction—they too can be changed. Money is a tool, not a master. The final breaking of the gold standard proved that conclusively. The challenge now is building institutions that use this flexibility to serve public purposes rather than allowing it to serve narrow interests. That challenge shapes the final chapter of our monetary history.

### The Breaking Was Inevitable

Nixon's August 15, 1971 announcement closing the gold window was presented as temporary—a brief suspension to address speculative attacks. Markets knew immediately it was permanent. Historians know why: the Bretton Woods system had been dying since its birth. The system contained three fatal flaws that made collapse not merely likely but **mathematically certain**.⁵⁶

**The System's Three Fatal Flaws:**

**Flaw 1: The Triffin Dilemma Was Structurally Unsolvable**

The world needed growing dollar supply for trade and reserves. Dollar convertibility required limiting dollar supply to match gold reserves. Mathematics made both impossible simultaneously. By 1971, foreign dollar liabilities ($80 billion) exceeded U.S. gold reserves ($10 billion) by a factor of eight. No policy choice could resolve this—only crisis.⁵⁶ᵃ

Triffin proved in 1959 that collapse was inevitable. It took twelve years to play out, but the outcome was never in doubt. The only question was timing.⁵⁶ᵇ

**Flaw 2: Asymmetric Adjustment Favored Surplus Countries**

Deficit countries (Britain 1967) were forced to deflate, accept IMF conditionality, impose austerity. Surplus countries (France, Germany) faced no penalties for hoarding gold, no requirement to appreciate currencies, no pressure to reduce surpluses. White had been "perfectly adamant" on this point—America wouldn't accept symmetric adjustment rules.⁵⁶ᶜ

The system rewarded mercantilist hoarding while punishing countries trying to maintain full employment. Recipe for persistent, growing imbalances that eventually overwhelmed the system.⁵⁶ᵈ

**Flaw 3: Capital Mobility Rendered Fixed Rates Unworkable**

The 1944 system assumed capital controls would hold. By the 1960s, telecommunications improvements and financial innovation (eurodollar market) made controls increasingly porous. Britain's 1967 crisis proved capital controls couldn't prevent speculative attacks when speculators sensed weakness.⁵⁶ᵉ

Technology was rendering Bretton Woods obsolete. Speculators could test currency promises faster than central banks could defend them. The impossible trinity—fixed rates, capital mobility, policy autonomy—admitted no solution.⁵⁶ᶠ

**The Miracle: It Lasted 27 Years**

The surprise isn't that Bretton Woods collapsed in 1971. The surprise is it lasted until 1971. Three factors bought time:⁵⁶ᵍ

1. **American gold reserves** ($24.6 billion in 1949) took decades to deplete through gradual outflows
2. **Soviet threat** created political pressure to maintain Western monetary unity despite strains  
3. **Bretton Woods generation** (central bankers who designed system) managed it with restraint and cooperation⁵⁶ʰ

But by 1971, all three factors were exhausted:

- Gold reserves down to $10 billion (depleted by 60%)
- Vietnam War divided West, reduced monetary cooperation
- New generation questioned why America should sacrifice domestic policy for system stability⁵⁶ⁱ

**The Question for Our Era:**

The pure fiat dollar standard faces different challenges than Bretton Woods. There's no mathematical impossibility as under gold convertibility—the U.S. can supply unlimited dollars. But the political economy creates tensions: dollar dominance gives America geopolitical leverage (sanctions, surveillance) that other nations increasingly resist, persistent U.S. deficits create political concerns even without solvency risk, and concentration of reserve currency power in one nation creates asymmetric adjustment burdens similar to what Keynes warned against.⁵⁶ʲ

Keynes's bancor proposal—updated as expanded IMF Special Drawing Rights or supranational reserve asset—could address these political tensions through symmetric rules and shared governance. But American power still resists surrendering seigniorage profits, monetary autonomy, and strategic leverage. The calculation remains: short-term national advantage versus long-term systemic stability. The difference from 1944 is that the system won't break from material exhaustion—it will only change through political crisis or deliberate reform.⁵⁶ᵏ⁻ˡ

**History's Lesson:**

Only crisis forces change. Bretton Woods ended not from wise choices but unbearable contradictions—Nixon's desperate response to Britain's conversion request.⁵⁶ᵐ Current strains are different but create political tensions: persistent U.S. deficits ($800+ billion annually), dollar weaponization driving alternatives (China's CIPS payment system, euro diversification), and geopolitical resistance to dollar dominance.⁵⁶ⁿ

**Systems designed to preserve dominant power rather than systemic stability face ongoing challenges.** Keynes understood bancor was superior for systemic stability; White chose American advantage. That gave us 27 years of growth under Bretton Woods, then crisis when material constraints broke the system. The post-1971 fiat system lacks that breaking point but faces the political challenge of managing power responsibly. The question: can we learn from 1944-1971 to reform before political crisis forces change?⁵⁶ᵒ⁻ᵖ

### **Chapter Summary**

Bretton Woods (1944) attempted to restore gold's discipline while preserving fiat's flexibility. Keynes's bancor—a supranational currency with penalties for surplus countries—lost to White's dollar-centered system backed by American gold. The compromise worked for 27 years but contained the Triffin dilemma: the world needed dollar outflows for liquidity, but persistent deficits undermined gold convertibility at $35/ounce. The London Gold Pool hemorrhaged $3 billion trying to defend the price. When Britain requested a $3 billion gold transfer in August 1971, Nixon closed the gold window. The suspension announced as temporary became permanent. The system had failed not because fiat money doesn't work but because the compromise tried to preserve gold's constraint while allowing fiat's flexibility—an inherent contradiction. Countries that left gold earlier in the 1930s had recovered faster, proving gold caused economic damage rather than preventing it. The final breaking revealed what 1797 and 1933 had shown: gold was never the foundation of monetary value; institutional credibility was. Money is a human institution, created by law and sustained by trust, serving economic needs rather than constraining them.
