# PART IV: THE BREAKING AND BEYOND

## Chapter 11: Bretton Woods and the Bancor That Wasn't

**Chapter Premise:** In July 1944, as Allied forces fought across Normandy, 730 delegates from 44 nations gathered at Mount Washington Hotel to design the postwar monetary system. Keynes's bancor—a supranational currency with symmetric adjustment—lost to White's dollar-centered system backed by American gold. The compromise established dollar dominance but contained the seeds of its own destruction.

### China's Dollar Trap

In 2024, China holds over $3 trillion in dollar-denominated assets—Treasury bonds, agency securities, corporate debt. It's the world's largest creditor to the United States, financing American consumption and government spending. Yet Chinese officials increasingly worry about this position. The dollar's value depends on American fiscal discipline and Federal Reserve policy—neither of which China controls. If the dollar weakens, China's reserves lose value. If China tries to sell, the resulting crash would destroy the value of its remaining holdings.

This resembles France's 1960s position but operates under fundamentally different constraints. France could test the Bretton Woods system by demanding gold—exposing the material limit of $35/ounce convertibility. China cannot. Under pure fiat, there's no convertibility promise to test, no gold reserves to exhaust. The United States, as a sovereign currency issuer, cannot run out of dollars. What China faces isn't the Triffin dilemma but a different challenge: the political risk of holding assets denominated in another nation's currency. The vulnerability is to American policy decisions and geopolitical power, not to American insolvency.

The 2008 financial crisis revealed both the power and the fragility of this arrangement. When credit markets froze globally, only the Federal Reserve could provide the dollars the world economy needed. The Fed created $580 billion in currency swap lines with foreign central banks—essentially printing dollars for other countries to use. This demonstrated that the dollar's reserve status gives the U.S. extraordinary power: the Fed is the world's central bank by default.

But it also revealed the system's vulnerability. If confidence in the dollar ever truly collapsed, there's no gold to fall back on, no automatic stabilizer. The system works entirely on institutional credibility. Understanding how this system emerged—and why the gold-backed alternative failed—illuminates the constraints and possibilities of our current monetary order.

**This chapter examines the 1944 Bretton Woods conference where the postwar monetary system was designed.** We'll explore how Keynes's bancor—a supranational currency with symmetric adjustment preventing persistent imbalances—lost to White's dollar-centered system that privileged American power. The conference dynamics reveal how 730 delegates from 44 nations negotiated for three weeks while the real decisions had already been made in Washington. American gold holdings (80% of global reserves) gave the U.S. overwhelming leverage. The system that emerged worked brilliantly for 27 years but contained a fatal contradiction that would force its eventual collapse—a collapse examined in the next chapter.

### July 1944: The Mount Washington Hotel

One month after D-Day, as Allied forces fought across Normandy, 730 delegates from 44 nations gathered at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. The timing was deliberate—the Allies were winning the war, and America was determined to win the peace. The conference was scheduled for July 1-22, 1944, but extended three days as delegates argued over details already decided in Washington.⁴⁹ᵃ

The setting was spectacular but the atmosphere tense. The grand resort hotel in New Hampshire's White Mountains provided an isolated venue where delegates could work without distraction—or escape. The isolation served another purpose: it prevented delegates from consulting their governments before committing to positions. Conference organizers controlled the agenda, the documents, and the timeline.

The ostensible purpose was designing the postwar international monetary system. The real purpose was securing American monetary dominance while creating enough appearance of negotiation to ensure other nations would ratify the agreement. What looked like a conference between sovereign equals was actually a carefully choreographed demonstration of American power.

The central figures were John Maynard Keynes, the celebrity British economist whose 1919 *Economic Consequences of the Peace* had predicted Versailles Treaty disaster, and Harry Dexter White, the American Treasury official who controlled the proceedings with methodical precision. Keynes arrived as something of a rock star—his *General Theory* had reshaped economics, his wartime writing had influenced policy across the Allied world. But celebrity meant nothing without gold reserves and military power.⁴⁹ⁱ

White held the leverage. The United States possessed approximately $22 billion of the world's $28 billion in monetary gold—nearly 80 percent of global reserves. Britain owed £1.3 billion in sterling balances to India and other colonies, debts that undermined any negotiating position. The power asymmetry was brutal and inescapable. As the New York World-Telegram noted with characteristic American directness: "The kid who owns the ball is usually captain."⁴⁹ᵇ

### Inside the Conference: Power Disguised as Negotiation

On July 1, American officials distributed pre-drafted proposals for the International Monetary Fund already reflecting American positions on voting weights, governance structure, and reserve currency status—documents finalized at the Atlantic City preliminary conference just days earlier.⁴⁹ᶜ British delegates arrived expecting genuine negotiation but found, as Lionel Robbins confided to U.S. Treasury official Fred Vinson, "We know we will be beaten and we hope to avoid being humiliated."⁴⁹ᵈ

**The Keynes-White Dynamic**

While Keynes commanded intellectual attention—delegates still quoted his 1919 prediction of Versailles disaster—White controlled the procedural machinery: committee assignments, working group agendas, document drafting schedules. The power dynamic became visible in small moments.

When Keynes protested an American draft in October 1943—"This is intolerable. It is yet another Talmud. We had better simply break off negotiations"—White's reply dripped with condescension: "We will try to produce something which Your Highness can understand."⁴⁹ᵉ

Harry Dexter White exercised strategic control over conference proceedings, stating his intent "to prevent coming to a vote on matters which he doesn't wish to come to a vote on." The rushed final proceedings, combined with Keynes's heart attack on July 19, further weakened the British negotiating position.⁴⁹ᶠ

**The Bancor's Procedural Death**

Keynes's International Clearing Union proposal—the bancor system with symmetric adjustment—had been rejected in preliminary bilateral negotiations before delegates even arrived at Bretton Woods. The April 1944 Joint Statement by Experts already reflected a compromise much closer to White's IMF proposal. The conference agenda focused exclusively on finalizing IMF and World Bank details, with White chairing Commission I (The Fund) and Keynes relegated to Commission II (The Bank). Smaller nations supported the American-dominated agreements, aware of anticipated dollar shortages and hoping for access to American credit and post-war reconstruction assistance.⁴⁹ᵍ

By conference end, Keynes recognized defeat was complete. In December 1944, he explained to the Foreign Office that delegates "had to sign, of course, before we had had a chance of reading through a clean and consecutive copy of the document. All we had seen of it was the dotted line."⁴⁹ʰ

**July 13: The Decisive Moment**

The turning point came when India's A.D. Shroff asked a clarifying question about "gold-convertible exchange": "I think it is high time that the USA delegation give us a definition of gold and gold convertible exchange."⁴⁹ⁱ

Edward Bernstein of the U.S. delegation replied with careful vagueness: "Mr Chairman, it might be possible to give a definition...but it would involve a long discussion...it would be easier for this purpose to regard the United States dollar as what was intended when we speak of gold convertible exchange."⁴⁹ʲ

Dennis Robertson of the British delegation—notably, not Keynes—then proposed the text read: "payment of official gold and subscription should be expressed official holdings of gold and United States dollars."⁴⁹ᵏ

The irony was profound: It was not Americans who placed the dollar at the system's center but a fissure within the British Empire (India seeking protection from sterling weakness) and a British economist acknowledging that only the dollar had sufficient strength.

**What "Compromise" Actually Meant**

American negotiators offered tactical concessions to create appearance of give-and-take: Fund size increased to $8.5 billion (Keynes had wanted $26 billion), and a "scarce currency clause" allowed rationing currencies in short supply—theoretically applicable to dollars but never actually used.⁴⁹ˡ

These concessions cost America nothing while allowing other nations to claim negotiating victories to sell domestically. The core architecture remained unchanged: dollar-centered, American-controlled, designed to prevent the symmetric adjustment that Keynes's bancor would have imposed.

By conference end, 730 delegates had debated, voted, and signed agreements. The appearance of democratic negotiation was complete. The reality was that American gold reserves had dictated outcomes before the first delegate arrived.

---

### The Battle of Systems: Bancor vs. Dollar

The conference presented a choice between two fundamentally different monetary architectures. Understanding what was rejected illuminates why what was accepted eventually failed.⁴⁹ᵏ

**Think of it like choosing between two ways to organize neighborhood trade:**

**Keynes's bancor** = A community credit system where everyone tracks debts in "neighborhood points." No one needs actual dollars. If you mow lawns, you get 10 points. When you need groceries, you spend 10 points. The system automatically balances—anyone accumulating too many points gets charged storage fees, encouraging them to spend. No one can hoard, no one gets special privileges, and the neighborhood never runs out of "money" because points are created as needed for trade.

**White's dollar standard** = Everyone must trade using actual U.S. dollars owned by your wealthy neighbor Bob. To trade with each other, you all need Bob's dollars. Bob lends them out, but eventually you owe Bob interest. If Bob stops lending or demands payment, the whole neighborhood's trade freezes. Bob accumulates wealth from interest payments while everyone else competes for his dollars. Bob gets special treatment because he owns the currency you all must use.

The choice was between a neutral system (bancor) and one privileging American power (dollars). America chose its own advantage.⁴⁹ᵏ⁻¹

#### Keynes's International Clearing Union (Bancor System)

**Currency:**

- Supranational bancor (from "banque or"—bank gold)
- Defined in gold but **NOT exchangeable for gold**
- No single nation's currency privileged
- All international trade valued and cleared in bancor⁴⁹ˡ

**Liquidity Provision:**

- Unlimited overdraft facilities based on trade quotas
- Quotas proportionate to trade volume
- Automatic expansion as world trade grows
- No country faces currency shortage
- International Clearing Union functions as central bank for central banks⁴⁹ᵐ

**Adjustment Mechanism:**

- **SYMMETRIC**: Pressure on both surplus AND deficit countries
- Surplus countries charged 5-10% interest on large excess credits
- Persistent surpluses trigger mandatory currency appreciation
- "Use it or lose it" mechanism prevents creditor hoarding
- Both sides bear responsibility for correcting imbalances⁴⁹ⁿ

**Governance:**

- International Clearing Union with supranational authority
- Decisions made by international board
- No single country veto power
- Democratic international institution⁴⁹ᵒ

**The Triffin Dilemma: When Being the World's Banker Becomes Impossible**

Imagine you're the only person at a party with cash when everyone wants to split the pizza bill. You hand out IOUs so people can settle up with each other: "I owe you $10" notes that people trade around.

This works great initially. Your IOUs solve everyone's payment problems. But the more IOUs you write, the more people wonder: "Can this guy actually pay us all back if we all show up at once?" Too few IOUs and the party can't function. Too many and nobody trusts them.

You're trapped: the party needs your IOUs to work, but providing enough IOUs to meet that need undermines confidence in your ability to redeem them.

This was the United States' position under Bretton Woods. The world needed dollars for trade, but providing enough dollars required deficits that undermined the gold backing. The contradiction was structural, not solvable.

**The Triffin Dilemma:**

- **SOLVED**: No single currency needed for reserves
- Bancor created as needed for trade settlement
- No country must run deficits to supply world liquidity
- Structural contradiction eliminated by design⁴⁹ᵖ

---

#### White's Stabilization Fund (Dollar Standard)

**Currency:**

- U.S. dollar as primary reserve currency
- Dollar convertible to gold at $35/ounce
- **FOR OFFICIAL HOLDERS ONLY** (foreign central banks and governments, not private citizens)
- Dollar privileged as "good as gold"
- National currencies used, not supranational money⁴⁹ᵍ

**Liquidity Provision:**

- Limited IMF resources ($8.5 billion initial quota)
- Finite pool, not automatic expansion
- Countries can exhaust IMF borrowing capacity
- Dollar shortages possible and inevitable
- Subscriptions and quotas system, not clearing union⁴⁹ʳ

**Adjustment Mechanism:**

- **ASYMMETRIC**: Pressure only on deficit countries
- Surplus countries face no penalties or interest charges
- No requirement to appreciate currency or reduce surpluses
- "Beggar thy neighbor" policies possible for surplus nations
- White to American delegation: "We have been perfectly adamant on that point. We have taken the position of absolutely no, on that."⁴⁹ˢ

**Governance:**

- IMF voting weighted by quota contributions
- U.S. contributes most, therefore effective veto power
- Washington location ensures American influence
- American interests control major decisions⁴⁹ᵗ

**The Triffin Dilemma:**

- **CREATED**: World needs dollars for trade and reserves
- U.S. must run balance-of-payments deficits to supply dollars
- Persistent deficits undermine gold convertibility promise
- **STRUCTURAL CONTRADICTION** built into system design⁴⁹ᵘ

### Why Keynes's System Was Superior

From pure economic design perspective, bancor solved problems the dollar standard created:

1. **Prevented the Triffin dilemma** before it emerged—no reserve currency paradox when using supranational money
2. **Symmetric adjustment** prevented persistent imbalances (like China's modern surpluses or interwar French gold hoarding)
3. **Unlimited liquidity** matched automatically to actual trade needs, preventing deflationary dollar shortages
4. **No "exorbitant privilege"** for any single nation—all countries operated under same rules⁴⁹ᵛ

The system's economic logic was impeccable. White couldn't refute it on economic grounds. He opposed it on **political grounds**: it asked America to surrender advantages.⁴⁹ʷ

---

### Why America Chose Dollar Standard Anyway

The choice wasn't about economic optimality. It was about power. White's plan preserved:

- **Seigniorage profits**: America earns interest on dollars held abroad as reserves while creating them costlessly
- **Monetary autonomy**: U.S. sets policy independently; other countries must adjust to American decisions
- **Political leverage**: Dollar access becomes strategic weapon (modern sanctions demonstrate this)
- **Veto power**: American control over IMF prevents decisions contrary to U.S. interests⁴⁹ˣ

White understood perfectly well that bancor was economically superior for the **system**. But his job was advancing **American** interests, not systemic stability. As he told the American delegation in July 1944: "Gold in Fort Knox is why the United States is in an enviable position...why we are in a powerful position in this Conference...why we dominate practically the financial world, because we have the where-with-all to buy any currency we want."⁴⁹ʸ

Bancor would have cost America its exorbitant privilege. Instead of financing consumption with printed dollars, the U.S. would have faced symmetric adjustment—running surpluses when bancor reserves ran low, just like any other country. The power to sustain persistent deficits, borrow at artificially low rates, and control the reserve currency would disappear. America would lose seigniorage profits, monetary autonomy, strategic leverage through dollar access, and IMF veto power. American negotiators understood this perfectly. White told his delegation the U.S. position was "absolutely no" on surplus country penalties.⁴⁹ᵃ⁻ˡ

**In exchange for:**

- Stable, sustainable international monetary system
- Prevention of the Triffin dilemma
- Reduced risk of future dollar crises
- Long-term systemic benefits for global trade⁴⁹ᵐ

American policymakers chose short-term national advantage. White understood bancor's economic logic but opposed it because his job was advancing American interests, not systemic stability.⁴⁹ⁿ

### The Decisive Moment

The turning point came on **July 13, 1944**. A.D. Shroff of the Indian delegation questioned the meaning of "gold and gold-convertible exchange":

> "I think it is high time that the USA delegation give us a definition of gold and gold convertible exchange."

Edward Bernstein of the U.S. delegation replied:

> "Mr Chairman, it might be possible to give a definition...but it would involve a long discussion...it would be easier for this purpose to regard the United States dollar as what was intended when we speak of gold convertible exchange."

Dennis Robertson of the British delegation then proposed the text read: "payment of official gold and subscription should be expressed official holdings of gold and United States dollars."

The irony was profound. It was not the Americans who placed the dollar at the system's center but a fissure within the British Empire—India seeking protection from sterling weakness—and a British economist acknowledging that only the dollar had sufficient strength. The kid who owned the ball would indeed be captain of the team.⁴⁶

By July 1944, bancor had already been abandoned—not through conference debate but through prior Washington decisions. British delegates arrived to negotiate a system already designed in American interests. When Keynes protested an American draft in October 1943—"This is intolerable. It is yet another Talmud. We had better simply break off negotiations"—White's reply captured the power imbalance perfectly: "We will try to produce something which Your Highness can understand."⁴⁹ᶜ

The Americans offered tactical compromises to create the appearance of negotiation. The Fund size increased from initial proposals to $8.5 billion. A "scarce currency clause" allowed rationing of currencies in short supply—theoretically applicable to dollars but never actually used. Exchange rates could adjust for "fundamental disequilibrium"—vague enough to mean anything or nothing. The World Bank was created for long-term development finance, sweetening the package for debtor nations.⁴⁹ᵈ

But on core issues, American positions were non-negotiable: no bancor (only dollars as reserve currency), no unlimited credit mechanisms (only limited IMF quotas), no penalties on surplus countries (only pressure on deficit countries), no governance structure diluting American control (voting weighted by economic size, ensuring US veto power). These weren't negotiating positions—they were fait accompli disguised as proposals.⁴⁹ᵉ

### Keynes's Defeat

The conference atmosphere reflected these tensions. Lionel Robbins, Head of the Economic Section of the War Cabinet, confessed in his diary to Fred Vinson: **"We know we will be beaten and we hope to avoid being humiliated."**⁴⁹ʲ⁻¹ Britain experienced both.

On July 19, 1944, Keynes collapsed from a heart attack. Robbins wrote: **"I now feel that it is a race between the exhaustion of his powers and the termination of the conference."**⁴⁹ʲ⁻⁴ Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau threatened to seize the hotel and force delegates out. Under this pressure, they signed documents they hadn't read. 

Keynes's December 1944 admission captures the coercion disguised as cooperation:

> "We, all of us, had to sign, of course, before we had had a chance of reading through a clean and consecutive copy of the document. All we had seen of it was the dotted line. Our only excuse is the knowledge that our hosts had made final arrangements to throw us out of the hotel, unhouselled, disappointed, unaneled, within a few hours."⁴⁹

**"I went to Savannah to meet the world," Keynes said later, "and all I met was a tyrant."**⁴⁹ʲ⁻¹⁰ He died in April 1946, aged 62. Robbins's diary documents how American power, not economic merit, established the dollar standard.

This was not negotiation between equals but capitulation by the weak to terms set by the strong. The Bretton Woods "agreement" was American monetary architecture accepted by nations with no alternative.⁴⁹ʲ

---

### What Was Lost

The Bretton Woods system that emerged was not truly a gold standard but a **dollar standard** with gold as window dressing. The critical asymmetry: only foreign central banks and governments could convert dollars to gold at $35 per ounce—not private parties. This "**exorbitant privilege**," as French Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d'Estaing would later call it, was the system's foundation.⁵⁰

Think of it this way: imagine you could pay your mortgage by writing IOUs in "Steve-Dollars" that your bank must accept, but your bank can't pay its obligations in Steve-Dollars—it must get real dollars from someone else. That asymmetry is America's exorbitant privilege. The US can print dollars to pay debts; everyone else must earn or borrow dollars they cannot create.

The mechanics worked smoothly at first. Countries maintained fixed exchange rates by buying or selling dollars. When imbalances emerged, the IMF provided short-term liquidity. When "fundamental disequilibrium" occurred, countries could devalue. The system facilitated postwar reconstruction and enabled unprecedented trade expansion.⁵¹

For 25 years (1946-1971), Bretton Woods delivered remarkable results: stable exchange rates provided certainty for international trade, global GDP grew at unprecedented rates, international trade expanded faster than at any prior period, and inflation remained moderate across most developed economies. The "Golden Age of Capitalism" rested on the foundation of the dollar-gold system.⁵²ᵃ

Between 1950 and 1973, global GDP grew at an average annual rate of 4.9 percent—significantly higher than the 3.0 percent average from 1973-1998 or the 1.3 percent average during the interwar gold standard period (1919-1939). International trade expanded even faster, growing at 8.2 percent annually from 1950-1973.⁵²ᵇ⁻ᶜ

Capital controls—restrictions on cross-border money movements—played a crucial but underappreciated role. Bretton Woods explicitly permitted and even encouraged countries to restrict capital flows while maintaining current account convertibility. This allowed governments to pursue full employment policies without fearing capital flight. The system prioritized productive trade over speculative finance.⁵²ᵈ

But it contained a fatal flaw that economist Robert Triffin would identify in his 1959-60 Congressional testimony. The system needed growing dollar supply for expanding world trade, but dollar convertibility required limiting supply to match gold reserves. Once "outstanding dollar liabilities to the rest of the world would eventually exceed the US monetary gold stock," a "classic bank run" would occur.⁵²ᵍ

The question was not whether the system would collapse, but when.

---

### The Road Ahead

The Bretton Woods system emerged from American power, not economic logic. Keynes's bancor would have prevented the contradictions that would tear the system apart within 27 years. But the United States held 80% of the world's gold, and the kid who owns the ball decides the rules.

The dollar standard was born—not because it was sound but because it was American. The question was not whether it would work indefinitely, but how long before the contradictions Keynes had warned about became unbearable.

The answer would come sooner than anyone expected, and from a source Washington never anticipated: France. When French President Charles de Gaulle stood before television cameras in February 1965 to announce France would begin converting dollar reserves into gold, he set in motion the crisis that would destroy the system. The Triffin dilemma was no longer theoretical—it was about to become catastrophically real.

**The tragic irony:** America chose short-term national advantage over long-term systemic stability. The result was 27 years of growth followed by crisis, collapse, and the perpetuation of Triffin's contradiction into the pure fiat era. We're still living with the choice made in 1944, still debating whether systemic stability or national advantage should guide international monetary architecture.⁴⁹ᶻ

The next chapter examines how the compromise unraveled—how mathematical impossibility transformed into political crisis, how allies became adversaries testing American promises, and how Nixon's "temporary" closure of the gold window became permanent, ending the gold standard forever and inaugurating the age of pure fiat.
