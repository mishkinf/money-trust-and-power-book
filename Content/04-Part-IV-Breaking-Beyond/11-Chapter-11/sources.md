# Chapter 11 Sources & Summary

## **Chapter Summary**

In July 1944, 730 delegates from 44 nations gathered at Mount Washington Hotel to design the postwar monetary system. Keynes's bancor—a supranational currency with symmetric adjustment preventing persistent imbalances—lost to White's dollar-centered system backed by American gold holdings (80% of global reserves). The Bretton Woods compromise established dollar dominance but contained fatal contradictions: the world needed dollar outflows for liquidity (requiring U.S. deficits), but persistent deficits undermined the gold convertibility that supposedly backed the system. This Triffin dilemma made collapse inevitable. The system worked brilliantly for 27 years, enabling unprecedented trade expansion and economic growth. But when pressures mounted—France's gold offensive (1965-1968), Britain's 1967 crisis, the London Gold Pool hemorrhaging $3 billion—Nixon closed the gold window in August 1971. What was announced as temporary became permanent, ending the gold standard forever and inaugurating the age of pure fiat.

49e. Keynes-White exchange, October 1943. Keynes: "This [American draft] is intolerable. It is yet another Talmud. We had better simply break off negotiations." White: "We will try to produce something which Your Highness can understand." Steil (2013), 165.

43f. Harry Dexter White exercised strategic control over conference proceedings, telling Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. that as chairman he aimed "to prevent coming to a vote on matters which he doesn't wish to come to a vote on, and in general arranging the discussion in such a way that we are never caught with an agreement among the Commission on something we don't want." Keynes's heart attack on July 19, 1944, further weakened the British negotiating position. Steil (2013), 212, 224; Skidelsky (2000).

49g. Keynes's International Clearing Union proposal was effectively rejected before the Bretton Woods Conference convened. The April 21, 1944 "Joint Statement by Experts on the Establishment of an International Monetary Fund" already reflected a compromise much closer to Harry Dexter White's IMF proposal. The May 25, 1944 U.S. invitation specified the conference was "for the purpose of formulating definite proposals for an International Monetary Fund," with no mention of the ICU. Smaller nations supported the American-dominated agreements primarily due to anticipated dollar shortages and the need for access to American credit and post-war reconstruction assistance. Paul Bareau quote: "we lost on every issue...Latin American delegations could be depended on to read...speeches prepared for them by the Secretariat of the United States delegation."

49h. Reflecting on the rushed final proceedings, Keynes wrote to the Foreign Office in December 1944: "We, all of us [delegates], had to sign, of course, before we had had a chance of reading through a clean and consecutive copy of the [Bretton Woods Articles of Agreement] document. All we had seen of it was the dotted line." Steil (2013), 251.

49z. New York World-Telegram (1943), quoted in Steil (2013), p. 189: "The kid who owns the ball is usually captain and decides when and where the game will be played...Since the U.S. now owns some twenty-two billions of the world's reported twenty-eight billions of gold, we think Uncle Sam is going to be the captain of the team or there will be no game."
