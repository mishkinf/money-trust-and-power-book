# The Final Breaking: 1914-1971

Winston Churchill stood at the dispatch box in the House of Commons on April 28, 1925, announcing Britain's return to the gold standard. The pound would once again be convertible at its pre-war parity: **$4.86 per ounce of gold**. Members cheered. The City celebrated. Britain had restored its honor, proving that the disruptions of the Great War were temporary aberrations. The pound would be "as good as gold" once more—a phrase that carried the weight of empire and the promise of stability.¹

What Churchill did not say—perhaps did not fully understand—was that the market exchange rate stood at **$4.77**. The official parity represented a **10 percent overvaluation**. British exports would become 10 percent more expensive overnight. To maintain the parity, British wages and prices would have to fall by 10 percent—a massive deflationary adjustment imposed on an economy still recovering from war. John Maynard Keynes, watching from Cambridge, understood immediately what Churchill had done. Within three months, he would publish a scathing pamphlet: *The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill*. Every prediction would come true.²

A century after Britain's first return to gold in 1821—which had caused devastating deflation and farmer insolvencies—the country was about to repeat the mistake. The gold standard that had seemed eternal before 1914 had already cracked during the Great War. The interwar attempt to restore it would fail catastrophically. By 1971, the last link between major currencies and precious metal would be severed—not through careful planning but through crisis and necessity. The final breaking would reveal what the first had hinted: gold had never been the foundation of monetary value. Trust was. And Churchill's decision would destroy that trust for millions of British workers.³

### Churchill's blunder

The problem was deceptively simple. The market exchange rate in January 1925 had been **$4.77**. The official parity of **$4.86** represented approximately **10 percent overvaluation**. British exports would be 10 percent more expensive to foreign buyers; British imports would be 10 percent cheaper. To restore competitiveness, British wages and prices would have to fall by 10 percent—a massive deflationary adjustment that would take years and destroy livelihoods.⁴

John Maynard Keynes, in a scathing pamphlet titled "The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill" (July 1925), predicted the consequences with precision:

- 10 percent reduction in export receipts
- Transfer of **£1 billion** from productive workers to rentiers (bondholders)
- Increased real burden of the National Debt by **£750 million**
- Deflation, unemployment, and social unrest³⁰

Every prediction came true. The coal industry, heavily dependent on exports, was hit first. Coal miners faced wage cuts; when they refused, mine owners locked them out. The dispute escalated into the **General Strike of 1926**—the largest industrial action in British history, with approximately **1.5-1.75 million workers** striking (roughly **7-8% of the British workforce**) in support of **1.2 million locked-out coal miners**.³¹ The overvalued pound drained gold reserves, forcing the Bank of England to maintain tight monetary policy. Unemployment remained high throughout 1925-1931.

Councillor Hugh Reynolds, a coalminer at Plean Colliery in Stirlingshire, experienced the lockout firsthand. By 1926 Reynolds was married with a wife and one young child.³¹ᵃ When mine owners demanded a 13 percent wage cut plus an extra hour per day in April 1926, Reynolds and his fellow miners refused.³¹ᵇ They had already endured years of wage stagnation—South Wales miners averaged only £2 13s 6d per week in 1925, far below the £3-4 often claimed.³¹ᶜ The lockout began May 1. The TUC called a General Strike in solidarity, but after nine days abandoned the miners, who remained locked out for seven more months—through November 1926.³¹ᵈ

Reynolds's family survived on 18 shillings worth of groceries per week—a voucher that barely fed three people.³¹ᵉ Even this meager relief was a loan: Reynolds later had to repay it at 1 shilling per week from his post-strike wages. Throughout the lockout, families survived on soup kitchens, charity, and community solidarity.³¹ᶠ Many went hungry. In November, with winter approaching and no resolution in sight, the miners were "finally starved into submission and forced to accept the owners' terms."³¹ᵍ They returned to work at the reduced wage—13 percent less than before—with an eight-hour day. Reynolds would spend the rest of his working life earning less, knowing the wage cut had nothing to do with productivity or market conditions. It was the price of Churchill's decision to value the pound's prestige over workers' livelihoods.

The lockout affected over 1.5 million workers. For families like the Reynolds, it meant months of hardship—reduced meals, unpaid rent, children going hungry. The strike was eventually broken, but the bitterness lingered. The gold standard had been restored, but at the cost of industrial peace and working-class living standards. Monetary policy, supposedly a technical matter for experts, had become a weapon in class conflict. The overvalued pound enriched bondholders and impoverished workers, redistributing wealth upward while economists debated exchange rate theory.

On September 21, 1931, Britain was forced off gold again. The experiment had lasted six years and accomplished nothing except economic hardship. Churchill later called it "the biggest blunder of my life." He should have either returned at a lower parity reflecting wartime inflation, or waited until prices adjusted naturally. Instead, he chose prestige over pragmatism—and Britain paid the price.³²

### The gold sinks

Britain's mistake was compounded by a global catastrophe: the **maldistribution of gold** in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Two countries—France and the United States—accumulated vast gold reserves while the rest of the world starved for liquidity. The result was the Great Depression.³³

France's share of world gold reserves rose from **7 percent** in 1926 to **27 percent** by 1932. By the Depression's depth, France held nearly as much gold as the United States, despite having an economy one-quarter the size. The causes were multiple: an undervalued franc (from the 1926 Poincaré stabilization), legal requirements that the Bank of France convert foreign exchange into gold, and a mandated **35 percent minimum gold cover ratio** that the Bank exceeded, reaching **80 percent** by 1932.³⁴

The United States contributed to the problem by **sterilizing** gold inflows between 1928 and 1930. When gold flowed into America, the Federal Reserve should have allowed the money supply to expand, raising prices and wages. Instead, it prevented monetary expansion, hoarding the gold while the rest of the world deflated.³⁵

Economist Douglas Irwin quantified the disaster. Between 1927 and 1932:

- World gold stock grew **24 percent**
- U.S. share increased **1 percent**
- France's share increased **24 percent**
- Rest of world: **0 percent**³⁶

By 1932, the U.S. and France held over **60 percent** of the world's monetary gold. Keynes called France a "gold sink." The phrase was apt: gold flowed in but did not circulate, trapped by legal requirements and central bank policy.³⁷

The impact on prices was devastating. Wholesale prices fell **34 percent** between 1928 and 1932. Irwin's analysis shows that U.S. and French gold hoarding explains approximately **40 percent** of this deflation. The gold standard, designed to provide stability, had become an engine of destruction.³⁸

Contemporary economists warned of the danger. Gustav Cassel, Keynes, and Allyn Young all predicted catastrophe if gold hoarding continued. They were ignored. Central bankers, trained to worship gold, could not imagine that their devotion to the metal was strangling the world economy.³⁹

### Roosevelt's revolution

On March 5, 1933, newly inaugurated President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared a **bank holiday**, closing every bank in America. The Emergency Banking Act, passed that same day, invalidated gold redemption. On April 5, Executive Order 6102 went further: it **banned private gold ownership**, requiring citizens to surrender gold coins, bullion, and certificates to the Federal Reserve by May 1. The penalty for non-compliance: **$10,000 fine** and/or **10 years imprisonment**. Only about 20-25 percent of gold was actually surrendered, but the message was clear: the gold standard was dead.⁴⁰

On January 30, 1934, the Gold Reserve Act formalized the new order:

- All monetary gold in the U.S. was **nationalized**
- The official price was set at **$35 per ounce** (from $20.67 since 1834)
- The dollar was **devalued** to 59.06 percent of its former value
- Gold redemption by Treasury and banks was **prohibited**
- Gold clauses in contracts were **abrogated**⁴¹

Critics called it default. The Supreme Court, in the *Consolidated Gold Clause Cases* (1935), narrowly upheld the government's actions. But the economic effects were undeniable: gold inflows accelerated, the money supply grew **10 percent annually** from 1933 to 1937, and GDP growth averaged over **8 percent** annually during the same period. The recovery from the Depression had begun.⁴²

Roosevelt's policies were controversial and remain so. But they demonstrated a crucial truth: **gold was not necessary for monetary stability**. What mattered was the government's ability to manage the money supply, maintain employment, and restore confidence. Gold had been a constraint, not a foundation.

---

### Bretton Woods: the dollar's triumph

The final act came in July 1944, as Allied forces fought across Normandy. At the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, 730 delegates from 44 nations gathered to design the postwar monetary system. The hotel, closed since 1942, had been hastily reopened for what Keynes called a "vast monkey-house" designed "so the President can say 44 nations agreed." The conference was scheduled to conclude July 19 but extended three days as delegates argued over the architecture of the postwar monetary order.⁴³

Two visions competed: John Maynard Keynes's **International Clearing Union** with a supranational currency called bancor, and Harry Dexter White's dollar-centered system backed by American gold.

**Keynes's International Clearing Union** was elegant and ambitious:

- A world central bank with supranational authority—a central bank for central banks
- **Bancor** as international currency (from "banque or"—bank gold), defined in gold but not exchangeable for it
- Quotas proportionate to trade volume, with overdraft facilities allowing potentially unlimited credit
- **Symmetrical adjustment**: countries with persistent surpluses would be penalized 5-10 percent interest on excess credits and required to appreciate currencies—a "use-it-or-lose-it" mechanism preventing creditor hoarding
- All international trade valued and cleared in bancor⁴⁴

**White's Stabilization Fund** was simpler and reflected American power:

- Fixed exchange rates: each currency pegged to the dollar within ±1 percent
- Dollar convertible to gold at **$35 per ounce**—but only for foreign central banks, not private citizens
- International Monetary Fund with finite resources ($8.5 billion, raised from White's initial $5 billion proposal)
- No penalty for surplus countries—White told the American delegation: "We have been perfectly adamant on that point. We have taken the position of absolutely no, on that."
- Primary adjustment burden on deficit countries only⁴⁵

---

### The decisive moment

The turning point came on **July 13, 1944**. A.D. Shroff of the Indian delegation questioned the meaning of "gold and gold-convertible exchange":

> "I think it is high time that the USA delegation give us a definition of gold and gold convertible exchange."

Edward Bernstein of the U.S. delegation replied:

> "Mr Chairman, it might be possible to give a definition...but it would involve a long discussion...it would be easier for this purpose to regard the United States dollar as what was intended when we speak of gold convertible exchange."

Dennis Robertson of the British delegation then proposed the text read: "payment of official gold and subscription should be expressed official holdings of gold and United States dollars."

The irony was profound. It was not the Americans who placed the dollar at the system's center but a fissure within the British Empire—India seeking protection from sterling weakness—and a British economist acknowledging that only the dollar had sufficient strength. The kid who owned the ball would indeed be captain of the team.⁴⁶

---

### Why bancor failed

White feared Keynes's International Clearing Union could create bancor at will, leaving the United States—the primary creditor—accumulating vast quantities of what he considered worthless paper while exporting real goods. As he wrote in August 1942:

> "There are some who believe that a universally accepted currency not redeemable in gold...is compatible with existence of national sovereignties....A little thought should, however, reveal the impracticability of any such notion."

The New York World-Telegram put it more bluntly in 1943:

> "The kid who owns the ball is usually captain and decides when and where the game will be played...Since the U.S. now owns some twenty-two billions of the world's reported twenty-eight billions of gold, we think Uncle Sam is going to be the captain of the team or there will be no game."

America held the leverage. Britain owed £1.3 billion in sterling balances to India and other colonies—debts that undermined any negotiating position. When Keynes protested an American draft in October 1943—"This is intolerable. It is yet another Talmud. We had better simply break off negotiations"—White replied: "We will try to produce something which Your Highness can understand."⁴⁷

The Americans offered compromises: increasing the Fund size to $8.5 billion, including a "scarce currency clause" allowing rationing of currencies in short supply, permitting some exchange rate flexibility for "fundamental disequilibrium," and creating the World Bank for long-term development finance. But they flatly rejected bancor itself, unlimited credit mechanisms, penalties on surplus countries, and any governance structure that would dilute American control.⁴⁸

Keynes signed the agreement in December 1944, later admitting:

> "We, all of us, had to sign, of course, before we had had a chance of reading through a clean and consecutive copy of the document. All we had seen of it was the dotted line. Our only excuse is the knowledge that our hosts had made final arrangements to throw us out of the hotel, unhouselled, disappointed, unaneled, within a few hours."⁴⁹

### The system in practice

The Bretton Woods system that emerged was not truly a gold standard but a **dollar standard** with gold as window dressing. The critical asymmetry: only foreign central banks and governments could convert dollars to gold at $35 per ounce—not private parties. This "exorbitant privilege," as French Finance Minister Valéry Giscard d'Estaing would later call it, was the system's foundation.⁵⁰

The mechanics worked smoothly at first. Countries maintained fixed exchange rates by buying or selling dollars. When imbalances emerged, the IMF provided short-term liquidity. When "fundamental disequilibrium" occurred, countries could devalue—as Britain did on **November 18, 1967**, reducing the pound from $2.80 to $2.40 (a 14.3 percent devaluation). Chancellor James Callaghan announced the decision on a Saturday evening at 9:30 PM. Prime Minister Harold Wilson's broadcast the next day—assuring citizens that "the pound here in Britain, in your pocket or purse...has been devalued"—was widely mocked, as the statement was technically false for domestic purchasing power.⁵¹

The system facilitated postwar reconstruction and enabled unprecedented trade expansion. But it contained a fatal flaw that economist Robert Triffin had identified in his 1959-60 Congressional testimony: once "outstanding dollar liabilities to the rest of the world would eventually exceed the US monetary gold stock," a "classic bank run" would occur.⁵²

---

### The Triffin dilemma quantified

The numbers told the story of a slow-motion crisis:

- **1949-50**: $24.6 billion in U.S. gold reserves (peak)
- **1958**: Overall U.S. external liabilities first exceeded gold stock
- **1962**: Liabilities to foreign officials exceeded gold reserves
- **1964**: $15.5 billion reserves versus liabilities (ratio approximately 1:1)
- **1966**: $13.2 billion reserves versus $14 billion central bank dollar holdings (ratio 0.94:1)
- **March 1968**: $10.7 billion (crisis low)
- **August 15, 1971**: Approximately $10 billion versus $80 billion foreign liabilities (ratio 0.125:1)⁵³

For the world to have enough dollars for trade and reserves, the U.S. had to run balance-of-payments deficits. But persistent deficits undermined confidence in dollar-gold convertibility. The system required the U.S. to be simultaneously strong (to maintain gold convertibility) and weak (to supply dollars to the world). The contradiction was unsustainable.

---

### The London Gold Pool: holding back the tide

The crisis came in waves. In November 1961, eight central banks formed the **London Gold Pool**, contributing 240 metric tons ($270 million) to defend the $35 per ounce price. The United States contributed 50 percent ($135 million); seven European central banks split the remainder. The Bank of England executed all transactions, selling gold when the London price approached $35.20 and buying when it weakened below $35.08.⁵⁴

For four years, the Pool worked. Between 1962 and 1965, it accumulated a cumulative surplus of $1.4 billion in purchases—the Pool was actually making money. But from 1965 to March 1968, it suffered a cumulative deficit of $3.7 billion. France withdrew in June 1967; the U.S. share rose from 50 to 60 percent. Between November 1967 and March 1968, the Pool lost nearly $3 billion in five months.⁵⁵

On March 14-15, 1968, the crisis reached its peak. The Queen declared a bank holiday to close the London gold market. On March 16-17, central bankers met in emergency session in Washington. The London Gold Pool was disbanded. In its place emerged the **two-tier gold market**: an official tier where central banks traded at $35 per ounce, and a private tier where market forces determined the price. When the private market reopened on April 1, 1968, gold traded at $38 per ounce—an 8 percent premium. By May 21, it had reached $42.60.⁵⁶

The two-tier system was a tacit admission that the Bretton Woods gold price was unsustainable. Central banks agreed to trade gold only at $35 per ounce among themselves, to supply no gold to private markets from official stocks, and to buy little or no gold from private sellers. The system limped along for three more years, but the end was inevitable.⁵⁷

---

### The Nixon Shock

By the late 1960s, the contradiction was unsustainable. The Vietnam War and Great Society programs had created large U.S. deficits. Dollars accumulated in foreign central banks, far exceeding U.S. gold reserves. France had been aggressively converting dollars to gold since de Gaulle's February 4, 1965 press conference—between 1962 and 1966, France reduced its dollar reserves by $2.8 billion, accounting for most of the $3.3 billion decline in U.S. gold stocks. Spain exchanged $60 million for gold in 1964-65, the "biggest transaction of the Franco era." The test came on **August 11, 1971**, when Britain requested a $3 billion gold transfer. Paul Volcker, then Under Secretary of the Treasury, later recalled: "If the British...were going to take gold for their dollars, it was clear the game was indeed over."⁵⁸

Four days later, on August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon appeared on television to announce that the United States would "temporarily" suspend dollar convertibility to gold. The announcement was a shock—no warning had been given to foreign governments or even to most U.S. officials. But it was also inevitable. The U.S. simply did not have enough gold to redeem all outstanding dollar claims.⁵⁹

The suspension was announced as temporary. It became permanent. By 1973, the Bretton Woods system had collapsed entirely. Major currencies began floating against each other, their values determined by market forces rather than fixed parities. For the first time in history, the world's monetary system was based entirely on **fiat currency**—money backed by nothing but government decree and public confidence.⁶⁰

The gold standard, which had dominated monetary thinking for two centuries, was dead. And remarkably, the world did not collapse. Inflation rose in the 1970s, but it was eventually controlled. Trade continued to expand. Financial markets adapted to floating exchange rates. The lesson was clear: **gold had never been necessary**. What mattered was institutional credibility, fiscal capacity, and the ability to manage monetary policy. These were human creations, not natural laws.⁶¹

---

### The liberation from gold

From the Bank Restriction Act of 1797 to the Nixon Shock of 1971, the story of money's evolution was a story of **institutional learning**. Each crisis revealed the same truth: gold was not the foundation of monetary value; trust was. And trust could be built without gold—if the institutions were credible, if the government could tax and spend responsibly, if the central bank managed the money supply prudently.⁵²

The breaking of the gold standard was not a failure but a **liberation**. It freed governments to pursue full employment, to respond to economic crises without being constrained by arbitrary metal reserves, to recognize that money was a tool for human purposes rather than a natural phenomenon to be worshipped. The transition was painful and often mismanaged. But it was necessary.⁵³

What remained was the challenge that had always existed: how to maintain trust in money when it was no longer backed by anything tangible. The answer, as Britain had discovered in 1797 and America rediscovered in 1971, lay in **institutions**—in central banks that managed money supply responsibly, in governments that taxed and spent within sustainable limits, in legal frameworks that protected property and enforced contracts. Money was a social technology, and like all technologies, it worked only when the underlying systems were sound.⁵⁴

The gold standard had been an accident, created by Newton's mathematics and sustained by British power. Its collapse was equally accidental, driven by war, depression, and the contradictions inherent in trying to base a growing global economy on a fixed supply of metal. What emerged from the wreckage was something more honest: money as a **human institution**, created by law and sustained by trust, serving the needs of the economy rather than constraining it. The breaking was complete. The age of fiat had begun.⁵⁵

The age of pure fiat had begun, but its architecture was still being built. How would central banks manage money creation without gold's constraint? How would governments maintain fiscal discipline without automatic limits? How would international coordination work without fixed exchange rates? These questions would shape the next half-century, as the world learned to operate a monetary system based entirely on institutional credibility. The answers would emerge through crisis and experimentation, revealing both the power and the fragility of money sustained by trust alone.

---

### **Chapter Summary**

The gold standard broke in three stages: 1797 (Bank Restriction Act suspended convertibility during Napoleonic Wars), 1914-1925 (World War I forced suspension, disastrous return at pre-war parity), and 1971 (Nixon closed gold window permanently). Each break revealed gold's limitations. The 1797-1821 suspension proved paper money could function without metal backing if institutions were credible—Bank of England notes circulated successfully for 24 years. The 1821 return to gold at pre-war parity caused devastating deflation: note circulation contracted 92%, wheat prices fell 58%, farmers faced insolvency. Churchill's 1925 return at $4.86 (10% overvalued) triggered the 1926 General Strike affecting 1.7 million workers and forced miners to accept 13% wage cuts. The gold standard imposed deflationary bias, redistributed wealth from debtors to creditors, and constrained policy responses to economic crises. Nixon's 1971 decision ended the system permanently, proving fiat money could work if institutions were credible. The lesson: money is institutional, not commodity-based—trust matters more than metal.
