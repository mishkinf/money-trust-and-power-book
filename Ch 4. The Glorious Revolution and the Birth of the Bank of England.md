# The Glorious Revolution and the Birth of the Bank of England

By 1688, England’s political and financial systems were at a breaking point. James II’s attempt to consolidate absolute power — expanding a standing army, filling offices with Catholics, and ignoring Parliament’s consent for taxes — had provoked deep opposition. His downfall was not only religious or constitutional; it was also fiscal. The English elite understood that no government could wage war, maintain order, or borrow money without the trust of its subjects and creditors.
When Parliament invited the Dutch prince William of Orange and his wife Mary, James’s Protestant daughter, to take the throne, they demanded a new constitutional order: the monarch would govern by Parliament, not above it. The Bill of Rights (1689) enshrined that the Crown could not raise taxes or maintain an army without Parliament’s consent. This reshaped the entire financial architecture of the kingdom: Parliament now controlled the purse, and that control would become the foundation of British credit.

War and the Birth of Public Debt
Almost immediately, England was drawn into the Nine Years’ War (1689–1697) against France’s Louis XIV. It was a conflict of unprecedented scale — one that required not just soldiers, but a modern fiscal machine. William III needed over £5 million annually to pay troops, purchase arms, and subsidize allies in Europe. Tax revenue covered barely half of that.
Merchants and goldsmith-bankers were wary of lending after the “Stop of the Exchequer” fiasco of 1672. They demanded new guarantees. Parliament responded with an innovation that changed the world: it created a permanent, legally binding link between public debt and taxation. Every loan to the government would now be backed by parliamentary appropriations — specific taxes earmarked to pay interest. This meant that creditors were no longer betting on the king’s personal honesty; they were betting on the nation’s ability to tax itself.
This principle gave rise to what historians call the “Fiscal-Military State.” For the first time, England could borrow vast sums at relatively low interest because lenders trusted Parliament’s legal control over revenue. War finance thus became institutionalized — the engine of empire and the model for modern public finance.

The Creation of the Bank of England (1694)
But even with Parliament’s new credibility, England needed an operational mechanism to mobilize large loans and manage its obligations. The solution came from a group of London merchants and financiers led by William Paterson and Michael Godfrey, who proposed a public–private partnership:
 create a joint-stock corporation that would lend money to the government in exchange for a royal charter and the right to issue its own notes.
In 1694, Parliament chartered the Bank of England. Investors subscribed £1.2 million in coin and tallies to lend to the government at 8 percent interest. In return, the Bank gained the authority to issue banknotes — paper receipts representing its own liabilities — which quickly began to circulate as money.
This was revolutionary. For the first time, the English state had an institution that could create money by double-entry bookkeeping. On the Bank’s ledgers, the transaction looked like this:
Assets
Liabilities
Loan to the Government £1.2 M
Banknotes Issued £1.2 M

The loan to the government was the asset; the new paper notes were the liability — circulating promises to pay. When the government spent those notes (paying soldiers, buying supplies, or funding allies), they entered the economy as new purchasing power.
The notes were redeemable in coin, but most holders simply used them in trade, trusting the Bank’s reputation and Parliament’s tax guarantees. In effect, England had created a self-reinforcing triangle:
The Bank created money by lending to the state.
The state spent that money into circulation.
Taxes, authorized by Parliament, ensured that the Bank and its notes retained value.


From an MMT perspective, this was a profound institutionalization of the “spend first, tax later” principle. The government could create new money to fund its operations, and taxation served to withdraw that money, control inflation, and guarantee demand for the currency.

Taxation: The Hidden Backbone of Confidence
It’s crucial to understand that taxation’s role here was not about raising revenue in a mechanical sense. It was about anchoring trust.
 Domestically, citizens needed pounds to pay their taxes; that obligation guaranteed a baseline demand for the Bank’s notes. Internationally, creditors and foreign governments cared that Parliament could legally compel the English people to pay taxes — not because they themselves would pay them, but because it demonstrated that the state had the power to make good on its promises.
In other words:
Taxation made the Bank’s money valuable at home.
Parliamentary taxation made it credible abroad.


This dual function of taxes — internal legitimacy and external solvency — is what made Britain’s experiment succeed where France’s absolutism failed. The French kings borrowed more but defaulted often because they lacked a representative body to secure revenues. England, after 1688, created the opposite model: limited monarchy, unlimited credit.
