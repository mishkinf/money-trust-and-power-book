# Monarchs, War, and the Invention of the Fiscal State

The royal treasury at Westminster was nearly empty. Outside, in the muddy streets of London, soldiers waited for their pay. Some had marched from Yorkshire; others had sailed from Portsmouth. All had fought for King Edward III in his war against France, and all expected coin—silver pennies stamped with the royal seal. But the Exchequer's coffers held only tally sticks and promises. The year was 1340, and England's king faced a problem that would haunt every European monarch for the next three centuries: **how to pay for war when the realm's wealth existed mostly on paper.**¹

Edward turned to the only people with liquid capital—Italian merchant-bankers. The Bardi and Peruzzi families of Florence had grown rich financing Mediterranean trade, and they understood the new instruments of credit. They advanced Edward gold florins and silver marks, recorded the debt in their ledgers, and waited for repayment. But when the king defaulted in 1345, unable to extract enough taxes from his subjects to satisfy foreign creditors, both houses collapsed. The shock rippled across Europe's financial networks. For a generation afterward, no banker would lend to an English king without collateral in hand.²

### The paradox of sovereignty

By the fourteenth century, European monarchs ruled territories larger and more populous than any ancient empire. Yet they were poorer in **disposable wealth** than a Mesopotamian temple or a Chinese provincial governor. The reason was structural: medieval kingship rested on feudal obligation, not bureaucratic extraction. A king could summon his vassals to war for forty days a year; he could collect customary dues on trade and justice; he could claim rents from royal lands. But he could not simply decree a tax and expect silver to flow into his treasury.³

War changed everything. The Hundred Years' War, the Italian Wars, the Wars of Religion—each conflict demanded resources on a scale that feudal dues could never provide. Cannons cost more than castles. Professional soldiers expected regular wages. Naval expeditions required not just ships but provisions, gunpowder, and foreign supplies. A single campaign could consume a decade's ordinary revenue.⁴

To finance these wars, kings needed to borrow. But **what** they borrowed, and **from whom**, determined whether they could ever repay.

### Domestic credit: the limits of tally sticks

Within England, the crown had long relied on a simple instrument: the **tally stick**. When a taxpayer delivered grain or coin to the Exchequer, a clerk notched a hazel rod to record the amount, split it lengthwise, and gave half to the payer. The stick itself became a receipt—proof of payment and a claim on future tax obligations. Because the crown accepted tallies in lieu of coin, they circulated as a kind of money. A merchant who held a tally for one hundred shillings could use it to pay his own taxes or sell it to someone who owed the king.⁵

This system worked brilliantly **within the realm**. Tallies were backed by the king's power to tax, and anyone who lived under English law eventually needed to satisfy the Exchequer. A tally was as good as silver because it canceled a debt that every subject would someday owe. The crown could, in effect, spend before it taxed—issuing tallies to pay soldiers or suppliers, confident that those instruments would return through the tax system.⁶

But tallies had a fatal limitation: **they could not cross borders**. A Flemish merchant selling wool to England might accept payment in tallies if he planned to buy English goods or pay English agents. But an Italian banker financing a war in France, or a German arms dealer supplying cannons, had no use for a stick of wood redeemable only in English taxes. They demanded **coin**—gold or silver that held value anywhere.⁷

This distinction between **domestic** and **foreign** borrowing defined the fiscal crisis of early modern monarchy. At home, a king could create credit by fiat, issuing promises backed by his authority to tax. Abroad, he was just another debtor, and his word alone meant nothing.

### What kings borrowed and why

When Edward III borrowed from the Bardi, he borrowed **gold florins**—Florentine coins that circulated across Europe as a trusted standard. When Henry VIII financed his wars against France in the 1540s, he borrowed from Antwerp bankers who advanced him **silver ducats** and **bills of exchange** payable in multiple currencies. When Philip II of Spain funded his armies in the Netherlands, he pledged future revenues from American silver mines—**metal that had not yet been dug from the ground**.⁸

What were these kings buying? Not abstractions, but tangible goods and services that could only be acquired abroad:

- **Mercenaries**: Swiss pikemen, German landsknechts, and Italian condottieri fought for cash, not feudal loyalty. They demanded payment in coin they could spend anywhere.
- **Warships and naval stores**: Timber from the Baltic, tar from Scandinavia, sailcloth from the Low Countries—all had to be purchased in international markets.
- **Gunpowder and weapons**: Sulfur from Sicily, saltpeter from India, bronze for cannons from German foundries.
- **Provisions for armies**: When an English army campaigned in France, it could not live off tallies. It needed bread, beer, and beef purchased locally—in French coin.⁹

Every foreign purchase required **exportable value**. A king could not pay a Venetian shipbuilder with a promise redeemable in London. He needed either **metal** (gold or silver coin), **goods** (wool, grain, or other exports), or **credit instruments** that foreign merchants would accept (bills of exchange drawn on trusted banking houses).¹⁰

This is why monarchs obsessed over their realms' supply of precious metal. Not because gold and silver were intrinsically valuable, but because they were the **universal language of international debt**. A gold coin minted in Florence could pay a soldier in Bruges, a merchant in Lisbon, or a banker in Augsburg. It was neutral collateral—a store of value that transcended political boundaries.

### The alchemy of coinage

If foreign creditors demanded metal, kings needed a way to concentrate it in their hands. The solution was **coinage mandates**—laws requiring that taxes, fines, and debts be paid in the king's own coin. By monopolizing the right to mint money and requiring its use for all obligations to the crown, a monarch could create demand for his currency even when the realm's economy ran on barter, credit, and foreign coins.¹¹

The logic was elegant: the state **spent first**, issuing coins to pay soldiers and suppliers. Those coins entered circulation, changing hands in markets and taverns. Eventually, they returned to the crown through taxes. The cycle created a perpetual demand for the king's money, because everyone who owed taxes needed to acquire it. As long as the king could enforce tax collection, his coins held value—not because of the metal content alone, but because of the **obligation** they satisfied.¹²

This was the same principle that had made Mesopotamian grain credits and Chinese jiaozi notes valuable: the issuing authority's power to demand them back. A coin was a portable tally stick, a tax credit stamped in metal. Its value derived not from the gold or silver itself but from the **legal requirement** to use it in dealings with the state.

Yet this domestic alchemy had no power abroad. A French merchant did not owe English taxes, so he had no reason to accept English coin at face value. He would take it only if the metal content justified the exchange rate—and kings, desperate for revenue, routinely debased their coinage, reducing the silver or gold and pocketing the difference. By the sixteenth century, Europe's monetary system was a chaos of clipped, sweated, and counterfeited coins, each trading at a discount to its nominal value.¹³

### The crisis of trust

The real problem was not metal but **credibility**. When a king borrowed, he promised to repay from future tax revenues. But could he? Medieval and early modern monarchs had no reliable bureaucracy for tax collection, no accurate census of their subjects' wealth, and no way to predict next year's harvest or trade flows. They borrowed optimistically and defaulted routinely.¹⁴

The English crown's record was particularly dismal. Edward III's default in 1345 destroyed the Bardi and Peruzzi. Henry VIII seized monastic lands to pay his debts, destabilizing the entire economy. Elizabeth I borrowed cautiously, but her successors—James I and Charles I—treated credit as an entitlement. Charles resorted to **forced loans**, imprisoning merchants who refused to lend, and arbitrary seizures of gold deposited at the Tower of London. When Parliament resisted his demands for new taxes, he dissolved it and ruled alone.¹⁵

The English Civil War (1642–1651) was many things—a religious conflict, a constitutional struggle, a clash of classes—but it was also a **fiscal reckoning**. Charles I's inability to finance his government without parliamentary consent revealed the bankruptcy of absolutism. When he was executed in 1649, it symbolized not just the death of a king but the death of an idea: that personal sovereignty could sustain public credit.¹⁶

The restored Stuart monarchy learned nothing. In 1672, Charles II faced a liquidity crisis. He had borrowed heavily from London's goldsmith-bankers—men who accepted deposits from merchants and lent to the crown at interest. When the Exchequer could not meet its obligations, Charles declared the **Stop of the Exchequer**, suspending all debt payments for one year. The goldsmiths were ruined. Some never recovered; others passed losses to their depositors. The City of London's financial community resolved that the crown would never again borrow on its word alone.¹⁷

### The circular trap

By the 1680s, England's monarchy faced a paradox that defined the age: **war required credit, but credit required trust, and trust required institutions the crown did not control**. A king could raise an army, but he could not raise the money to pay it. He could declare war, but he could not compel his subjects to finance it. And he could not borrow abroad without offering collateral—metal, goods, or credible promises—that his domestic authority could not guarantee.¹⁸

France faced the same problem. Louis XIV waged nearly continuous war from 1667 to 1714, draining the kingdom's wealth and driving it into debt. French kings borrowed from tax farmers—private financiers who paid the crown upfront for the right to collect taxes—but the system was corrupt and inefficient. Lenders demanded exorbitant interest because they knew the king might default. And when he did, as in the repudiation of debts in 1648 and 1661, it only made future borrowing more expensive.¹⁹

Spain's monarchy, despite the wealth of its American empire, declared bankruptcy in 1557, 1560, 1575, 1596, 1607, 1627, and 1647. Each default destroyed the fortunes of Genoese and German bankers who had financed Habsburg wars. Yet each time, the cycle repeated: war, borrowing, default, and a new generation of creditors willing to gamble on royal promises.²⁰

The pattern was universal. Monarchs could not wage modern war without credit. But they could not sustain credit without surrendering control over the very power—taxation—that made them sovereign. The solution, when it came, would not be a financial innovation but a **political revolution**.

### The invention of the fiscal state

What Europe needed was a way to make royal debt **credible** without relying on royal virtue. The answer emerged not from economic theory but from constitutional struggle: **parliamentary control of taxation**. If a representative body, rather than the king alone, authorized taxes and guaranteed their use for debt repayment, then creditors could trust the nation even if they distrusted the monarch.²¹

The Dutch Republic pioneered this model in the late sixteenth century. After rebelling against Spanish rule, the United Provinces created a federal system where provincial assemblies controlled taxation and borrowing. Because creditors knew that taxes were legally committed to debt service, they lent to the Dutch at interest rates far below those charged to absolute monarchs. The Dutch could borrow more, at lower cost, than any kingdom in Europe—and they used that advantage to build a commercial empire.²²

England would follow the same path, but only after a revolution. In 1688, when Parliament invited William of Orange to take the throne, it imposed a condition: the king would govern **with** Parliament, not above it. The Bill of Rights (1689) made explicit what the Civil War had implied—the crown could not raise taxes or maintain an army without parliamentary consent. That constitutional settlement transformed England's credit overnight.²³

For the first time, lenders could trust that their loans were backed not by a king's promise but by a **nation's legal obligation**. Parliament could commit future tax revenues to debt repayment, and no monarch could unilaterally repudiate that commitment. The fiscal-military state was born—a government capable of mobilizing resources on a scale that would have astonished Edward III or Charles II.

But the machinery of that state—the institution that would turn parliamentary promises into liquid credit—had yet to be invented. That innovation, the **Bank of England**, would complete the revolution that began in 1688. It would transform the nature of money itself, proving that credit backed by taxation could circulate as freely as gold.
