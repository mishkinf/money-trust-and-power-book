## What This Achieves

### Dramatically Strengthened Arguments

**Chapter 3:**
- Vyner as Lord Mayor while bankrupt = unforgettable proof of sovereign default's absurdity
- 30-year legal battle = shows elite creditors get decades of litigation, ordinary depositors get nothing
- Specific names, amounts, outcomes = makes abstract concepts concrete
- Pattern clear: sovereign default on elites ≠ sovereign default on ordinary people

**Chapter 8:**
- **Overstone's club gatekeeping quote = explicit proof of institutional capture**
- Norman family 123-year continuity = shows multi-generational embedding
- Attwood's 200,000 people vs. "soon bored" MPs = proves popular will ≠ monetary policy
- Contrasting endings (Attwood dies obscure, Overstone dies honored) = tragic human arc

### Publication-Grade Research

- Primary sources: Calendar of Treasury Books, Burnet, O'Brien's Correspondence
