## EDITING TASKS

### TASK 2.1: Restructure Opening with Datini Vignette

**Current structure:**
- Lines 1-18: Contemporary SWIFT/credit card opening
- Lines 19-55: Abstract bills of exchange mechanics
- Lines 56-69: Datini vignette (currently buried)

**New structure:**
- Lines 1-18: Contemporary opening (keep as-is)
- **NEW Lines 19-50:** Datini vignette (expanded)
- Lines 51-85: Bills of exchange mechanics (explained through Datini example)

**Detailed instructions:**

1. **Move Datini vignette** from current lines 56-69 to immediately after line 18

2. **Expand Datini section** to 400-500 words showing:

```markdown
**Francesco Datini's Morning, Florence, 1392**

On a Tuesday morning in May 1392, Francesco Datini sat in his counting house on the Via Porta Rossa, examining a piece of parchment that had just arrived from Barcelona. It wasn't money—it was better than money. It was a **bill of exchange** for 500 florins, drawn on his correspondent bank in Venice.

[INSERT FROM RESEARCH: Specific details about:]
- The exact wording of the bill
- Who issued it in Barcelona and why
- What trade transaction it represented
- Datini's calculation: Is this bill trustworthy?

Datini had three choices:
1. **Hold it** and collect in Venice himself (risky, slow)
2. **Discount it** to another Florentine merchant who needed Venice funds (quick cash, fee paid)
3. **Pass it through the network** to a correspondent in Bruges who owed him money

He chose option 3. Within the hour, he had endorsed the bill and sent it to [NAME FROM RESEARCH], who would send it to Bruges, where it would eventually settle in Venice without a single gold coin crossing the Alps.

This wasn't magic. It was the medieval financial network working as designed—credit flowing through trusted relationships, converting obligations across cities, all backed by the implicit promise that if anyone in the chain defaulted, sovereign authorities could enforce collection.

But what Datini didn't know that Tuesday morning was that the system's foundation was already cracking. In London, King Edward III was depleting his treasury on war with France. In Florence, the Peruzzi bank had extended so much credit to Edward that a single royal default would collapse the entire network. The bill in Datini's hand would clear successfully. But within 50 years, bills just like it would become worthless when sovereign backing failed.
```

3. **Connect to mechanics explanation:**

After the Datini vignette, add transition:

```markdown
To understand how Datini's bill worked—and why sovereign backing mattered—we need to trace its journey step by step through the medieval financial network.
```

4. **Use Datini example** throughout mechanics explanation (lines 51-85):
   - When explaining "payable at a future date" → reference Datini's 90-day term
   - When explaining "endorsement" → show Datini's signature on back
   - When explaining "network trust" → show why Bruges correspondent accepted it

**Research checkpoint:**
- [ ] Check Research folder for Datini correspondence examples
- [ ] If found: Use actual dates, amounts, cities from historical records
- [ ] If not found: Create plausible example based on known Datini trading patterns
- [ ] Verify typical bill terms (90 days? 60 days?) from research
- [ ] Add footnote citing Datini archive or secondary source on his operations

**Citation requirements:**
- Add footnote for Datini bill example (primary source if available, or secondary source like Origo's *The Merchant of Prato*)
- Update Sources section with Datini-related citations

---

### TASK 2.2: Build Tension Toward Peruzzi Collapse

**Current state:**
- Peruzzi collapse mentioned at lines 160-172 but arrives abruptly
- No buildup showing systemic risk accumulation
- Readers don't understand WHY one default caused network collapse

**New approach: Add "The Network Under Strain" subsection**

**Insert new section** between line 159 (end of Wisselbank section) and line 160 (Peruzzi collapse):

```markdown
### The Network Under Strain

By the 1330s, the medieval credit network that Datini would later navigate so successfully was approaching its breaking point. The Peruzzi and Bardi banks of Florence—the era's financial giants—had extended enormous credit to King Edward III of England to finance his wars against France.

[INSERT FROM RESEARCH: Specific numbers if available]
- Total Peruzzi loans to Edward III: [AMOUNT]
- Number of bills of exchange outstanding across Europe: [NUMBER]
- Correspondent banks holding Peruzzi paper: [LIST]

The warning signs were visible to those who knew where to look. [INSERT FROM RESEARCH: Evidence of concern]
- Letters between merchants expressing anxiety about English exposure
- Spread widening on bills drawn on English correspondents
- Peruzzi partners [NAMES IF AVAILABLE] seeking to reduce Edward exposure

But the network's interconnection meant individual banks couldn't simply withdraw. If Peruzzi refused to issue new bills to Edward, their existing loans would never be repaid. If they continued lending, they compounded their exposure. The logic of sunk costs trapped them: in for a penny, in for a pound.

[INSERT FROM RESEARCH: The moment of realization]
When news reached Florence in [YEAR—verify 1343? 1345?] that Edward had suspended debt payments, the Peruzzi partners faced a calculation that would determine not just their fate but the fate of dozens of correspondent banks across Europe:

- Outstanding Peruzzi bills: [NUMBER/AMOUNT]
- Bills already endorsed to other banks: [NUMBER/AMOUNT]
- Each bill represented a promise backed by Peruzzi's reputation
- Each promise was now backed by nothing

The collapse came in waves, not all at once. London correspondents holding Peruzzi bills tried to collect in Florence. Florentine partners couldn't pay. Bills were dishonored. Merchants holding those bills turned to their correspondents in Bruges, Venice, Barcelona. The cascade spread through the network like ripples from a stone dropped in a pond—except each ripple represented a bank failure, a merchant's ruin, a generation's accumulated wealth vanishing.
```

**Research checkpoint:**
- [ ] Search Research folder for Peruzzi/Bardi collapse details
- [ ] Find: Total loan amounts to Edward III
- [ ] Find: Timeline of collapse (1343? 1345? Exact dates?)
- [ ] Find: Names of Peruzzi partners if available
- [ ] Find: Evidence of warning signs (merchant letters, account books showing withdrawal attempts)
- [ ] Find: Cascade sequence (which cities/banks failed in what order)

**If research insufficient:**
- Use general banking history sources for systemic risk mechanics
- Draw parallels to 2008 Lehman collapse (known cascade dynamics)
- Add footnote acknowledging incomplete records: "Precise figures for the Peruzzi collapse are unavailable; estimates range from..."

**Citation requirements:**
- Add specific citations for Peruzzi collapse
- Update Sources section with medieval banking history sources
- If using estimates, cite the historians providing those estimates

### TASK 2.3: Strengthen "Foundation Beneath Network" Section

**Current state (lines 73-84):**
- Makes the argument effectively but could be more emphatic
- Claims "sovereign currency backed by taxation" but doesn't show what happens when that fails

**Enhancement:**

After line 84, add new paragraph:

```markdown
**What happens when the foundation cracks?** The Peruzzi collapse provided empirical proof. When Edward III defaulted, the bills of exchange didn't simply lose value—they became impossible to settle. A merchant in Venice holding a bill drawn on London couldn't collect because the sovereign backing the pound sterling had repudiated his debts. The bill was denominated in pounds, but pounds were only valuable because Edward's government required tax payment in them. When Edward stopped honoring obligations to foreign creditors, the tax-backed currency continued functioning domestically (English subjects still paid taxes in pounds), but the international credit network built on top of it collapsed.

[INSERT FROM RESEARCH: Specific example if available]
This is why merchants couldn't create their own unit of account independent of sovereigns. Datini could have written a bill saying "payable in 500 Datini ducats, redeemable for 10 bolts of wool." But who would accept it? The wool's value fluctuated. Datini might die or go bankrupt. There was no authority to enforce collection. Sovereign currency worked because:

1. **Stable unit of account**: The florin, pound, or ducat had relatively stable value backed by taxation
2. **Legal enforcement**: Courts could compel payment in sovereign currency
3. **Tax acceptability**: The ultimate settlement mechanism was sovereign's acceptance for taxes

When sovereign backing failed (Edward's default), so did the bills built on it. When sovereign backing held (Florentine republic's fiscal capacity), bills functioned beautifully. The lesson: private credit creation requires public monetary foundation.
```

**Research checkpoint:**
- [ ] Verify: Did English domestic currency continue functioning after Edward's default?
- [ ] Find: Examples of merchants trying to create independent units of account (if any)
- [ ] Confirm: Legal mechanisms for bill enforcement in medieval period

**Citation requirements:**
- Add citation for Edward III default's differential impact (domestic vs. international)
- Cite legal history sources on bill enforcement mechanisms

---

### TASK 2.4: Enhance Amsterdam Wisselbank Section

**Current state (lines 106-116):**
- Explains the system well but abstractly
- Doesn't show the practical difference it made

**Enhancement:**

Replace abstract explanation with concrete before/after comparison:

```markdown
### The Amsterdam Wisselbank: A System That Worked

Before 1609, an Amsterdam merchant settling accounts faced chaos. [INSERT FROM RESEARCH: Number of coins in circulation—some sources cite 500+ varieties]. The Dutch Republic alone minted coins in seven provinces. Foreign traders brought English pounds, French écus, Spanish reales, German thalers. Each coin had official value, but actual value depended on:
- Wear (clipped edges, filed weight)
- Debasement (how much silver actually in the coin)
- Exchange rate (what someone would actually pay for it)

**A typical transaction** [INSERT FROM RESEARCH: Specific example if available]:
- Merchant A buys goods worth "1,000 guilders"
- But paying requires: 300 coins of 12 different types
- Each coin must be weighed, assayed for purity, valued against current exchange rates
- Transaction takes 2-3 hours, requires money changer, costs 2-3% in fees
- Risk of fraud, clipped coins, forgeries

After the Amsterdam Wisselbank opened in 1609:
- Merchant deposits mixed coins at the bank
- Bank credits account with standardized "banco guilders" based on actual metal content
- Merchant A transfers banco guilders to Merchant B's account
- Transaction takes 5 minutes, costs minimal fee, zero fraud risk
- Both merchants can withdraw physical coins later if needed, but most never do—they trade banco guilders indefinitely

The Wisselbank succeeded because it combined:
1. **Public institution**: City of Amsterdam guarantee (not private bank subject to failure)
2. **100% reserve backing**: Every banco guilder backed by physical metal in vault
3. **Sovereign foundation**: Ultimately backed by Dutch Republic's taxation and enforcement
4. **Network effects**: As more merchants used it, value increased

[Keep existing paragraph about it becoming the model...]
```

**Research checkpoint:**
- [ ] Find: Number of coin varieties in circulation (verify "500+" claim)
- [ ] Find: Wisselbank adoption timeline (how quickly did merchants switch?)
- [ ] Find: Transaction cost comparison (before/after percentages)
- [ ] Find: Vault reserves data (did it really maintain 100%? Or fractional?)

**Citation requirements:**
- Add specific citations for Wisselbank operations
- Cite historical sources on pre-1609 Amsterdam payment chaos
- Update Sources section with Dutch banking history sources
