# PROMPT 05: GLOBAL ACCESSIBILITY PASS

## Objective

Apply consistent accessibility standards across all chapters to ensure the manuscript maintains the readability of Chapters 1-2 throughout. This addresses the problem where early chapters are beautifully accessible but middle chapters become progressively denser.

## The Accessibility Standard

Every chapter should pass the "smart general reader" test:
- College-educated reader with no economics background
- Interested in the topic and willing to engage
- Will struggle with unexplained jargon or overly academic prose
- Expects trade nonfiction, not academic text

## Systematic Changes Across All Chapters

### 1. Jargon Audit and Remediation

SEARCH entire manuscript for these terms and DEFINE on first use:

**Tier 1 - Must Define:**
- Chartalism / chartalist
- Metallism / metallist  
- Bullionism / bullionist
- Endogenous money
- Loanable funds
- Reserve requirements
- Convertibility
- Specie / bullion
- Fiscal capacity
- Seigniorage
- Debasement
- Agio / premium
- Giro transfers
- Tax-farming
- Corvée labor

**How to define:** Brief parenthetical on first use: "chartalism (the theory that money derives value from taxation authority)"

**Tier 2 - Can Use But Watch Density:**
- Balance of payments
- Current account / capital account
- Exchange rate mechanism
- Monetary base
- M1, M2 (money supply measures)
- Discount rate / Bank Rate
- Gold points
- Parliamentary appropriation

**Tier 3 - Avoid Entirely (Use Plain English):**
- Instead of "accommodation" → "supporting" or "allowing"
- Instead of "sterilization" → "preventing money supply growth"
- Instead of "procyclical" → "amplifying economic cycles"
- Instead of "exogenous" → "external" or "imposed from outside"
- Instead of "nominal" vs "real" → explain the distinction each time

### 2. Sentence Length and Complexity

RUN THIS CHECK on every paragraph:

✓ Average sentence length under 25 words
✓ No more than 2 sentences over 35 words per paragraph
✓ Complex sentences broken up with em-dashes or semicolons for clarity
✓ Each paragraph makes ONE main point

**Example of what to fix:**

BEFORE (too complex):
"The convertibility requirement that temple notes be convertible to grain or silver means they differed fundamentally from modern fiat currency, suggesting that credit and commodity money coevolved rather than credit preceding commodity entirely."

AFTER (clearer):
"Temple notes could be exchanged for actual grain or silver. This convertibility requirement meant they differed fundamentally from modern fiat currency. Rather than credit fully preceding commodity money, the two likely coevolved."

### 3. Paragraph Chunking

NO PARAGRAPH should exceed 150 words without a break.

LONG PARAGRAPHS to identify and split:
- Chapter 3, lines 90-104 (Why foreigners demanded gold)
- Chapter 4, lines 65-75 (Charter renewal bargain)
- Chapter 5, lines 64-88 (Two-tier banking system) - already addressed in Prompt 03
- Chapter 6, lines 75-91 (Bank Rate manipulation)
- Chapter 7, lines 151-173 (Intellectual blind spot)
- Chapter 8, lines 175-195 (Bretton Woods negotiations)

SPLITTING STRATEGY:
- Find natural logical break (shift in focus, new example, contrasting point)
- Insert paragraph break
- Add brief transition phrase to new paragraph if needed

### 4. Analogies and Examples

ADD concrete analogies to explain abstract concepts:

**Needed analogies:**
- **Fractional reserve banking** (Chapter 5): "Like a coat check that issues 100 tickets for 20 coats, knowing most people won't claim them simultaneously"
- **Gold points mechanism** (Chapter 6): "Like arbitrage between two stores pricing the same item differently, but with shipping costs"
- **Triffin dilemma** (Chapter 10): "Like a store that must give away its inventory to stay in business"
- **Productive capacity constraint** (Chapter 11): "Like printing movie tickets—you can print unlimited tickets, but if the theater has 100 seats, excess tickets just cause fighting over seats"

**Where to add examples:**
- Chapter 3: Add concrete example of a specific mercenary contract and how it required exportable value
- Chapter 6: Add example of actual arbitrage trade (buy silver in England, ship to France, buy gold, return)
- Chapter 8: Add example of British family's budget during deflation
- Chapter 11: Add example of how QE worked in practice for a specific bank

### 5. Chapter Opening Consistency

EVERY CHAPTER must have:

**Line 1-3: Scene-setting** (concrete, sensory, specific)
- GOOD EXAMPLE: Chapter 1 opening (Uruk scribe)
- NEEDS WORK: Any chapter starting with abstract statement

**Line 4-10: Stakes and relevance**
- What problem does this chapter address?
- Why does it matter for understanding money?

**Line 11-15: Roadmap**
- Brief preview of chapter's arc
- Not detailed outline, just general trajectory

**CHECK AND REVISE:**
- Chapter 5 opening is too abstract—add scene
- Chapter 7 opening works but could strengthen stakes
- Chapter 10 opening could be more dramatic (Bretton Woods)

### 6. Transition Quality

CHECK transitions between:
- Chapters (last paragraph → next chapter first paragraph)
- Major sections within chapters
- Examples to analysis

**ADD transition paragraphs where needed:**
- Between Chapter 6 and 7 (Newton's accident to Bank Restriction)
- Between Chapter 8 and 9 (Interwar period to modern era)
- Within Chapter 7 between historical narrative and intellectual debate

**GOOD TRANSITION TEMPLATE:**
"[Brief recap of what reader just learned]. But [introduce tension/question]. [Preview next section]."

EXAMPLE:
"The gold standard had been restored, proving Britain's institutional commitment. But the human cost was staggering—farmers bankrupted, workers impoverished, families destroyed. This pattern would repeat whenever gold's discipline clashed with human needs. The question was whether the lesson would be learned or forgotten."

### 7. "Why This Matters Now" Additions

ADD to end of each chapter (before chapter summary) a 2-3 paragraph section titled **"Why This Matters Now"** or **"Contemporary Relevance"**

**Template:**
- Paragraph 1: Connection to current debate/policy
- Paragraph 2: Specific contemporary example
- Paragraph 3: Forward-looking question or implication

**Examples:**

**Chapter 1:** "Today's MMT debates echo the ancient recognition that money is credit, not commodity. When economists argue about whether government spending is 'financially constrained,' they're unwittingly reenacting the metallist-chartalist debates of antiquity."

**Chapter 3:** "Modern governments face the same dual money problem Edward III confronted: they can create domestic currency freely, but international creditors demand proof of fiscal capacity. When markets attack sovereign debt—Greece 2010, Argentina 2001—they're demanding the same assurance medieval creditors sought: can this government actually collect taxes?"

**Chapter 7:** "The manufactured orthodoxy of 1821-1844 has modern echoes. When central banks claim to be 'out of ammunition' or politicians insist we 'can't afford' programs, they invoke the same fictional constraints that served creditor interests in the 19th century. Understanding how that orthodoxy was constructed helps us question whether similar constraints are real or rhetorical today."

### 8. Data Presentation

REVIEW all statistical content. Apply these rules:

**Choose ONE key number** per concept:
- NOT: "The Bank's reserves fell from £8 million in 1791 to £5.3 million in early 1797 and £1.2 million by February 25"
- INSTEAD: "The Bank's reserves had collapsed to barely £1 million—enough to redeem only one-tenth of notes outstanding"

**Provide context** for all numbers:
- GDP percentages
- Purchasing power equivalents
- Comparison to familiar modern amounts

**Move detailed statistics to endnotes** unless essential to narrative flow

### 9. Voice Consistency

REVIEW for tonal shifts. Eliminate:
- Sudden shifts from narrative to academic
- Passive voice where active works ("It was believed" → "Economists believed")
- Hedging language ("It might be argued that perhaps" → "The evidence suggests")
- Excessively formal constructions ("It would not be inappropriate to observe" → "Notice that")

**MAKE CONSISTENT:**
- Level of formality
- Use of first person (occasional "we" is fine for synthesis)
- Attitude toward reader (teaching, not lecturing)

### 10. Glossary Cross-References

For any technical term used more than once:
- Define clearly on first use
- ADD to glossary (see Prompt 06 for glossary creation)
- On subsequent uses, consider adding "(see Glossary)" for complex terms readers might have forgotten

## Implementation Process

**Phase 1: Automated Search**
1. Search for all Tier 1 jargon terms
2. Verify each has parenthetical definition on first use
3. Add definitions where missing

**Phase 2: Manual Review**
1. Read each chapter straight through as general reader
2. Mark any sentence requiring re-reading
3. Mark any paragraph that loses momentum
4. Flag any jargon that wasn't caught in Phase 1

**Phase 3: Systematic Fixes**
1. Break up long paragraphs (>150 words)
2. Shorten overly complex sentences (>35 words)
3. Add analogies where concepts remain abstract
4. Insert "Why This Matters Now" sections

**Phase 4: Consistency Check**
1. Verify chapter openings follow template
2. Check transitions between sections
3. Ensure voice is consistent
4. Confirm data presentation follows rules

## Quality Checks

After completing accessibility pass, test by reading aloud:

✓ Can you read each sentence without stumbling?
✓ Would your words make sense to someone listening?
✓ Do technical concepts build logically from simple to complex?
✓ Could your college-educated friend follow this?

If any answer is no, revise until yes.

## Expected Outcome

A manuscript where:
- Every chapter is as accessible as current Chapters 1-2
- Technical concepts are explained before being used
- Jargon is defined on first use or avoided entirely
- Paragraphs are digestible chunks
- Examples and analogies clarify rather than complicate
- The voice is consistently authoritative but approachable
- Readers can follow the argument without struggle

Target: Reduce "this is hard" moments by 80% while maintaining intellectual rigor.
