# PROMPT 12A: Citation & Fact Verification (Chapter-by-Chapter)

**Time Estimate:** 3-4 hours per chapter  
**Applies To:** Each chapter individually  
**Priority:** HIGHEST - Must be completed before other PROMPT-12 tasks

---

## OBJECTIVE

Verify every factual claim, citation, date, number, and quote in a single chapter. This is the most intensive fact-checking pass and must be done chapter-by-chapter due to the detailed verification required.

---

## PROCESS (Apply to ONE chapter at a time)

### Step 1: Read Chapter Completely
- Read the entire chapter from start to finish
- Note all factual claims, dates, numbers, quotes, and citations
- Identify anything that seems unsourced or potentially fabricated

### Step 2: Verify All Quantitative Claims

**Dates:**
- ✓ Conference dates (e.g., Bretton Woods July 1944)
- ✓ Crisis dates (e.g., Lehman Brothers September 15, 2008)
- ✓ Gold standard chronology (Britain left Sept 1931, US March 1933, France Sept 1936)
- ✓ Treaty/law dates (Bank of England Act 1844, Federal Reserve Act 1913)
- ✓ Historical event dates (General Strike May 1926, Stop of Exchequer 1672)

**Numbers:**
- ✓ Percentages (e.g., "France held 27% of world gold reserves by 1932")
- ✓ Dollar amounts (e.g., "Bear Stearns $30 billion bailout")
- ✓ GDP figures (e.g., "U.S. GDP grew 8% annually 1933-1937")
- ✓ Debt amounts (e.g., "National debt rose from 42% to 78% of GDP")
- ✓ QE quantities (e.g., "Fed balance sheet expanded from $900B to $4.5T")
- ✓ Gold holdings (e.g., "U.S. held 40% of world monetary gold")

**Names and Titles:**
- ✓ Correct spellings (John Maynard Keynes, not "Keynes," Winston Churchill not "Churchhill")
- ✓ Accurate positions ("Chancellor of the Exchequer" not "Finance Minister")
- ✓ Proper dates for roles (e.g., "Arthur Burns, Fed Chairman 1970-1978")
- ✓ Organization names (International Monetary Fund, not "IMF" on first use without defining)

**Quotes:**
- ✓ Exact wording from sources (check against research files or original sources)
- ✓ Context accurate (quote not taken out of context)
- ✓ Attribution correct (verify who said what)
- ✓ Date/location of quote if relevant

### Step 3: Citation Completeness Check

**Every factual claim needs support:**
- ✓ Statistics → footnote to research source
- ✓ Historical events → footnote to historian or primary source
- ✓ Quotes → footnote with page number
- ✓ Economic data → footnote to official source (Fed, BLS, etc.)
- ✓ Common knowledge exceptions: widely known facts (e.g., "WWII ended in 1945") don't need citations

**Citation quality check:**
- ✓ Are internal research files cited? (BAD - replace with root source)
- ✓ Are Wikipedia citations present? (ACCEPTABLE for biographies, dates; SUPPLEMENT with academic sources for key claims)
- ✓ Does each citation include sufficient detail? (Author, title, year, page numbers where applicable)
- ✓ Chicago Manual 17th edition format followed?

**Cross-reference with Research folder:**
- ✓ For each major claim, check if supporting documentation exists in @Research folder
- ✓ If research file has root sources, use those in chapter citations (not the research file itself)
- ✓ If no source found in research: FLAG WITH [VERIFY] TAG

### Step 4: Flag Suspicious Claims

**Mark with [VERIFY] tag if:**
- No source can be found in Research folder or chapter citations
- Claim seems too specific/detailed to be unsourced
- Numbers seem round or suspiciously precise without citation
- Quote lacks source attribution
- Historical detail that would require archival research but isn't cited

**Example:**
> The interest rate reached exactly 21.5% [VERIFY - check if this is cited; seems very specific]

### Step 5: Chicago Style Citation Verification

**Check all existing footnotes/endnotes:**
- ✓ Consistent format (author-date or notes-bibliography?)
- ✓ Proper punctuation (periods, commas in right places)
- ✓ Italics for book titles, quotes for article titles
- ✓ Complete publication information (city: publisher, year)
- ✓ Page numbers included where appropriate
- ✓ Ibid. used correctly (only for immediately preceding source)

**Footnote numbering:**
- ✓ Sequential within chapter
- ✓ No skipped numbers
- ✓ No duplicate numbers
- ✓ Superscripts in correct positions (after punctuation, not before)

### Step 6: Bibliography Check (If chapter has separate sources section)

- ✓ All footnoted sources appear in bibliography
- ✓ Bibliography entries complete and properly formatted
- ✓ Alphabetical order (if applicable)
- ✓ Consistent format across all entries

## CHAPTER-BY-CHAPTER WORKFLOW

**Do this for EACH chapter in order:**

1. **Start:** "Beginning citation/fact verification for Chapter [N]"
2. **Read:** Read entire chapter, taking notes on claims
3. **Verify:** Go through each factual claim systematically
4. **Cross-check:** Compare with Research folder sources
5. **Flag:** Add [VERIFY] tags where sources missing
6. **Document:** Create completion report for chapter
7. **Move to next chapter**

**Don't skip chapters. Do them sequentially:**
- Preface
- Chapter 1
- Chapter 2
- ...
- Chapter 13
- Epilogue

---

## OUTPUT PER CHAPTER

Create a brief report documenting:

```
## Citation/Fact Verification: Chapter [N]

**Status:** Complete ✓

**Issues Found:**
- [List any issues: missing citations, incorrect dates, etc.]

**[VERIFY] Tags Added:** [Number]
- Line [X]: [Brief description of what needs verification]

**Citations Checked:** [Number]
**Dates Verified:** [Number]
**Numbers Verified:** [Number]
**Quotes Verified:** [Number]

**Action Items:**
- [Any follow-up needed]

**Time:** [Hours spent]
```

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

For each chapter, verify:
- ✅ Every factual claim either has citation OR is flagged with [VERIFY]
- ✅ All dates cross-checked against known chronologies
- ✅ All numbers traceable to sources
- ✅ All quotes have source attribution
- ✅ No internal research files cited (only root sources)
- ✅ Chicago Manual style consistent
- ✅ Footnote sequence correct

---

## SPECIAL ATTENTION AREAS

**High-risk for unsourced claims:**
- Human stories (verify names, dates, specific details)
- Economic statistics (GDP, unemployment, gold reserves)
- Direct quotes (especially from historical figures)
- Specific amounts (dollar figures, percentages)
- Historical event details (participants, outcomes)

**Common citation problems:**
- Round numbers without sources (e.g., "about 1 million" needs citation)
- Transitional/synthetic claims (combining multiple sources into one statement)
- Background/context paragraphs (need citations even if "common knowledge")
- Tables and figures (need complete source citations in captions)

---

## NOTES

- **Be thorough, not fast.** 3-4 hours per chapter is expected.
- **When in doubt, flag it.** Better to over-flag than miss a problem.
- **Document your work.** Keep notes on what you verified for each chapter.
- **Use Research folder extensively.** Most claims should be traceable to files there.
- **No hallucinations.** If you can't verify it, flag it. Don't assume.

---

## DEPENDENCIES

- Must have access to @Research folder contents
- Must have chapter sources/bibliography sections available
- Should complete before PROMPT 12B (Consistency Audit)
