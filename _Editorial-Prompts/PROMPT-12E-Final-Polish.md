## PART I: CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE VERIFICATION (1 hour)

### Check All Contemporary Openings

**Verify each chapter's contemporary opening still relevant:**

**List of contemporary openings to check:**
- ✓ Chapter 1: Bitcoin/cryptocurrency
- ✓ Chapter 2: Credit card/SWIFT systems
- ✓ Chapter 3: Greece eurozone crisis
- ✓ Chapter 4: 2008 financial crisis / shadow banking
- ✓ Chapter 5: Federal Reserve money creation
- ✓ Chapter 6: Gold standard nostalgia
- ✓ Chapter 7: 2020 Fed $3 trillion creation
- ✓ Chapter 8: Household budget metaphor
- ✓ Chapter 9: Eurozone's interwar replay
- ✓ Chapter 10: [Verify what contemporary opening exists]
- ✓ Chapter 11: COVID stimulus debate
- ✓ Chapter 13: 2008/2020 Fed response

**For each opening, ask:**
- Is this still timely? (Not outdated by events)
- Is this still relevant? (Still matters to readers)
- Are dates/facts current? (No incorrect "current" references)
- Does it connect clearly to chapter's historical content?

**Common problems:**
- COVID references feeling stale (if book published in 2025-2026)
- Cryptocurrency examples outdated by market changes
- Political references that have expired
- "Current" crisis that's now resolved

**Fix by:**
- Updating examples to more recent/evergreen ones
- Changing "currently" to specific dates
- Replacing outdated references with timeless ones
- Ensuring historical lessons still apply to stated contemporary issue

### Verify "Why This Matters Now" Integration

**Per PROMPT-09, check:**
- ✓ Contemporary relevance integrated throughout (not just at end)
- ✓ 3-5 callbacks to opening per chapter
- ✓ Conclusions tie to contemporary application
- ✓ Doesn't feel forced or tacked on

**Test:**
- Reader should finish each chapter thinking "This explains what's happening now"
- Not "That was interesting history but what does it mean for me?"

## PART II: EMOTIONAL ARC VERIFICATION (1 hour)

### Human Stories Present

**Verify all planned human stories included:**

**Part I (Origins):**
- ✓ Amat-Sîn (Mesopotamian merchant)
- ✓ Francesco di Marco Datini (medieval merchant)

**Part II (Institutional Revolution):**
- ✓ Edward Backwell (goldsmith banker, Stop of Exchequer)

**Part III (Gold Standard):**
- ✓ James Woodforde (diarist during Bank Restriction)
- ✓ Thomas Attwood (Birmingham currency reformer)
- ✓ Farmers (various from deflation periods)

**Part IV (Breaking and Beyond):**
- ✓ Harry Todd (coal miner, 1926 General Strike)
- ✓ Farmer A (Iowa foreclosure)
- ✓ Maureen McKenzie (2008 foreclosure)
- ✓ Barbara Kantor (2008 small business credit freeze)
- ✓ **Victor Klemperer** (Weimar hyperinflation) [PROMPT-11]
- ✓ **Kono** (Japan Lost Decades) [PROMPT-11]
- ✓ **Morvan Lebesque** (French Depression) [PROMPT-11]

**Epilogue:**
- ✓ Returns to human dimension (not pure theory/policy)

### Suffering → Understanding → Hope Arc

**Verify three-act structure:**

**Act I: Suffering (Parts I-III)**
- Does book show monetary policy's human cost?
- Are consequences visceral, not abstract?
- Do readers feel the impact on real people?

**Act II: Understanding (Part IV, especially Ch 10-13)**
- Does book explain WHY suffering occurred?
- Is causation clear (not random or inevitable)?
- Do readers understand policy choices that caused problems?

**Act III: Hope (Epilogue, conclusions)**
- Does book offer institutional solutions?
- Is ending hopeful, not despairing?
- Do readers finish empowered, not defeated?

**Test:**
- Book should be honest about costs BUT optimistic about possibilities
- Should avoid both naive optimism AND cynical despair
- Should end: "We can do better if we understand how money works"

---

## PART III: PROFESSIONAL COPYEDIT (2 hours)

### Spelling & Grammar

**Run automated checks:**
- ✓ Spell-check entire manuscript
- ✓ Grammar check (Grammarly, ProWritingAid, or similar)
- ✓ Verify British vs American spelling consistent throughout

**Manual checks for common errors:**
- ✓ it's/its (possessive vs contraction)
- ✓ affect/effect (verb vs noun)
- ✓ that/which (restrictive vs non-restrictive clauses)
- ✓ their/there/they're
- ✓ your/you're
- ✓ who/whom
- ✓ fewer/less (countable vs uncountable)

**British vs American consistency:**
- **Choose one dialect** (probably American for U.S. publishers)
- **Common differences:**
  - labor/labour
  - recognize/recognise
  - center/centre
  - defense/defence
  - analyze/analyse
  - -ize/-ise endings

**Exception:** Keep British spelling in quoted material from British sources

### Punctuation Consistency

**Em-dash, en-dash, hyphen:**
- **Em-dash (—):** Use for parenthetical thoughts—like this—or abrupt changes
- **En-dash (–):** Use for ranges (1914–1918), connections (Churchill–Keynes debate)
- **Hyphen (-):** Use for compound modifiers (twenty-first century, well-known fact)

**Common mistakes:**
- Using hyphens where em-dashes needed
- Using em-dashes where en-dashes needed
- Inconsistent spacing around dashes

**Quotation marks:**
- **American style:** "Double quotes" for speech, 'single quotes' for quotes-within-quotes
- **British style:** 'Single quotes' for speech, "double quotes" for quotes-within-quotes
- **Choose one and be consistent**

**Comma usage:**
- Oxford/serial comma: Decide yes or no, apply consistently
  - "France, Britain, and America" vs "France, Britain and America"
- After introductory phrases: consistently use or omit
- Before "and" in compound sentences: consistently apply rule

### Formatting Consistency

**Heading hierarchy:**
- ✓ # Part (if Parts have titles)
- ✓ ## Chapter
- ✓ ### Major sections
- ✓ #### Subsections
- ✓ No heading levels skipped

**Blockquotes:**
- ✓ Format consistently (> markdown or other)
- ✓ Attribution style consistent
- ✓ Indentation/spacing consistent

**Footnotes/Endnotes:**
- ✓ Format consistent (Chicago style)
- ✓ Numbering sequential within chapter OR within book (choose one)
- ✓ Superscripts after punctuation, not before
- ✓ All footnotes have matching citations

**Tables/Figures (if any):**
- ✓ Numbered consistently
- ✓ Captions complete with sources
