# EDITORIAL REVISION PROMPTS - README

## Overview

This folder contains comprehensive editorial prompts for revising "Money, Trust, and Power" from a strong but uneven manuscript into a publication-ready trade book for major publishers (Penguin, HarperCollins, etc.).

**Current Status:** Manuscript has excellent core argument, solid research, and good writing but needs:
- Structural reorganization (9 chapters → 11 chapters in 4 Parts)
- Enhanced accessibility (especially middle chapters)
- Expanded modern era coverage (1971-present)
- Consistent voice and pacing throughout

**Target Outcome:** A manuscript that competes effectively with Graeber's *Debt*, Martin's *Money*, and other successful trade economics books while maintaining scholarly rigor.

## Additional Notes

### On Major Changes

These prompts are **not shy about proposing major changes** because major changes are necessary. This includes:
- Splitting chapters that are too dense
- Expanding chapters that are too thin
- Moving material between chapters
- Creating entirely new sections
- Cutting tangential material

**Philosophy:** Better to get it right than to preserve existing structure.

### On Preserving Quality

While making accessibility improvements:
- **Never sacrifice accuracy** for simplicity
- **Keep all citations** and source references
- **Maintain intellectual rigor** while improving readability
- **Preserve the author's voice** while making it more consistent

### On Judgment Calls

These prompts provide detailed guidance but cannot anticipate every situation. When facing judgment calls:
- Prioritize the reader's experience
- Follow the accessibility standards from Prompt 00
- Ask: "Would this help or hinder a smart general reader?"
- Err toward clarity over cleverness

## Questions or Issues?

If implementing these prompts raises questions:
1. Consult Prompt 00 (Overview) for core principles
2. Check whether other prompts address the issue
3. Apply the "smart general reader" standard
4. Document decisions and rationale

## Final Note

This is a comprehensive revision process transforming a good manuscript into an excellent one. The investment of time and effort is substantial, but the result will be a book worthy of major publication and broad readership—a book that changes how people understand money, government, and the relationship between them.

The manuscript has all the right ingredients. These prompts organize them into a recipe that works.
