## Research Finding

**Original Claim:** "Officials expected the suspension to last six weeks"

**Research Result:** **INCORRECT** - No primary source evidence supports "six weeks"

**Accurate Information:**
- **Announced duration:** One year
- **Statutory expiration:** June 24, 1797 (approximately 7-8 weeks from May 3, 1797 passage)
- **Actual duration:** 24 years (1797-1821)

## Source of Confusion

The "six weeks" claim likely stems from:
1. Pitt's political rhetoric: "a few weeks" (not "six weeks")
2. Rounding of 7-8 week statutory period
3. Confusion with 1803 amendment (6 weeks after parliamentary session)

## What Was Changed

### Preface (00-Preface/01-main.md)

**BEFORE:**
> Officials expected the suspension to last six weeks [VERIFY - check Bank Restriction Act for original duration expectation].

**AFTER:**

## Conclusion

The "six weeks" claim was a persistent historical misconception. The research definitively establishes that:

1. The suspension was **announced to last one year**
2. The statutory text specified **June 24, 1797** (7-8 weeks)
3. No contemporary source mentions **"six weeks"** specifically
4. The claim likely arose from conflating Pitt's rhetoric, statutory period, and later amendments

The correction strengthens the book's scholarly credibility by replacing an unsourced claim with properly documented historical fact from the most authoritative recent research (O'Brien & Palma 2020).
