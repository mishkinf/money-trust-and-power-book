# EDITORIAL VISION: OVERVIEW

## Purpose of This Prompt Collection

This folder contains detailed editorial prompts for revising "Money, Trust, and Power" from a strong but uneven manuscript into a publication-ready trade book for major publishers.

## Core Editorial Philosophy

**THE CENTRAL PROBLEM:** The manuscript currently reads like an excellent academic book when it needs to be an accessible trade book. It has all the right ingredients—compelling argument, solid research, good writing—but they're not yet optimally arranged for a general educated audience.

**THE SOLUTION:** Restructure for pacing, simplify for accessibility, expand the modern era, and make every chapter as engaging as Chapters 1-2 currently are.

## Key Principles for All Revisions

1. **No Sacred Cows:** Every chapter, paragraph, and sentence can be revised if it serves the book better
2. **Accessibility First:** If an economist wouldn't struggle but an intelligent general reader would, simplify it
3. **Show Don't Tell:** Use concrete examples, human stories, and vivid scenes rather than abstract exposition
4. **Contemporary Relevance:** Every historical episode should connect explicitly to current debates
5. **Narrative Momentum:** Each chapter should pull readers forward, not just inform them

## Target Reader Profile

- **Education Level:** College-educated, reads *The Economist*, *The Atlantic*, NPR listener
- **Prior Knowledge:** Understands basic economics but not monetary theory
- **Motivation:** Wants to understand money/government finance debates but finds academic texts impenetrable
- **Comparable Reading:** Has read Graeber's *Debt*, Piketty's *Capital*, or Harari's *Sapiens*

## Success Criteria

After revisions, the manuscript should:

1. **Hook readers immediately** with the counterintuitive revelation
2. **Maintain consistent accessibility** across all chapters (not just early ones)
3. **Balance narrative and analysis** without becoming too academic
4. **Give adequate weight to modern era** (1971-present)
5. **Make explicit connections** between historical lessons and current policy debates
6. **Create emotional engagement** through human stories and stakes
7. **Have consistent chapter structure** with clear signposting

## Revision Sequence

Execute these prompts in numbered order:

**Phase 1: Structural (Prompts 01-03)**
- Major reorganization into 4 parts, 11 chapters
- Strengthen Preface as conceptual foundation
- Create new transitional material

**Phase 2: Chapter-Level (Prompts 04-11)**
- Revise each chapter for clarity, pacing, accessibility
- Split dense chapters, consolidate thin ones
- Extract intellectual debates into dedicated chapter

**Phase 3: Enhancement (Prompts 12-14)**
- Global accessibility pass
- Add contemporary relevance connections
- Create front/back matter

**Phase 4: Polish (Separate process)**
- Line editing
- Fact-checking
- Final consistency review

## Research Resources Available

All source material and research notes are in:
`/Users/mishkinfaustini/workspace/Money, Trust, and Power Book/Research/`

Draw on these materials as needed to:
- Expand thin sections
- Add concrete examples
- Verify historical claims
- Strengthen contemporary connections

## Tone and Voice Guidelines

**Maintain throughout:**
- **Authoritative but not arrogant:** Confident knowledge without condescension
- **Engaged but not preachy:** Clear point of view without polemic
- **Accessible but not simplistic:** Clear explanations without dumbing down
- **Narrative-driven but rigorous:** Good storytelling without sacrificing accuracy

**Avoid:**
- Academic jargon without definition
- Dense paragraphs without breaks
- Abstract theory without concrete examples
- Historical detail without clear relevance
- Data dumps without interpretation

## Quality Control

After implementing each prompt, verify:

✓ Would a smart general reader understand this without struggle?
✓ Does this chapter maintain narrative momentum?
✓ Are technical concepts explained before being used?
✓ Does this connect to contemporary relevance?
✓ Would this engage the target reader emotionally and intellectually?

If any answer is "no," revise until it's "yes."

## Implementation Notes

- **Be bold:** Major restructuring is necessary and approved
- **Preserve quality:** Don't sacrifice accuracy for accessibility
- **Add material:** Where chapters are thin, expand using Research folder materials
- **Cut ruthlessly:** Where chapters are dense, remove tangential material
- **Maintain citations:** Keep all source references even when restructuring

## Expected Outcome

A manuscript that:
- Competes effectively with Graeber, Martin, and other trade economics books
- Satisfies both general readers and experts
- Generates discussion and media attention
- Positions author as public intellectual on monetary policy
- Achieves critical and commercial success
