# Deep Research Query: Bank Restriction Act 1797 - Expected Duration

## Context

The book's Preface currently states:

> "In 1797, the Bank of England suspended gold convertibility—the ability to exchange paper money for a fixed amount of gold—to finance a war. Officials expected the suspension to last six weeks [VERIFY - check Bank Restriction Act for original duration expectation]. It lasted twenty-four years."

## Research Question

**What was the originally expected duration of the Bank Restriction Act of 1797 when it was first enacted?**

## Specific Information Needed

1. **Primary Question:** Did officials/Parliament expect the Bank Restriction Act suspension to last "six weeks" or some other specific short duration when enacted in February-March 1797?

2. **Supporting Evidence Needed:**
   - Direct quotations from the Bank Restriction Act itself (37 Geo. III, c. 45, 1797)
   - Parliamentary debates from February-March 1797 discussing expected duration
   - Privy Council minutes or correspondence from February 26-28, 1797
   - Contemporary newspaper accounts or pamphlets discussing the suspension
   - Bank of England Court of Directors minutes from February-March 1797
   - Letters or memoirs from key figures (Pitt, Bank Directors, etc.) discussing expectations

3. **Alternative Formulations:**
   - If "six weeks" is not accurate, what was the expected duration?
   - Was any specific timeframe mentioned in the original Act or debates?
   - Was it characterized as "temporary" without specific duration?
   - When did expectations shift from short-term to long-term suspension?

## Desired Output Format

### If "Six Weeks" is Confirmed:

**Finding:** The Bank Restriction Act of 1797 was originally expected to last [six weeks/specific duration].

**Evidence:**
1. [Direct quotation from primary source with full citation]
2. [Additional supporting evidence with full citation]
3. [Context explaining why this duration was expected]

**Recommended Citation for Book:**
[Exact citation to use in footnote, Chicago style]

### If "Six Weeks" is NOT Confirmed:

**Finding:** The Bank Restriction Act of 1797 was originally expected to last [actual duration/characterized as temporary without specific timeframe].

**Evidence:**
1. [Direct quotation from primary source with full citation]
2. [Explanation of what was actually said/expected]
3. [Why "six weeks" may be a misconception]

**Recommended Revision for Book:**
[Suggested replacement text with proper citation]

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Primary source evidence (Act itself, Parliamentary debates, or contemporary documents)
- ✅ Direct quotations showing expected duration
- ✅ Full Chicago-style citations for all sources
- ✅ Clear answer: either confirm "six weeks" or provide correct information
- ✅ Sufficient evidence to remove [VERIFY] tag with confidence

## Additional Context

This is for a scholarly book on monetary history. The claim needs to be either:
1. **Verified with proper citation** (if "six weeks" is accurate), OR
2. **Corrected with proper citation** (if "six weeks" is inaccurate)

The book already has extensive sources on the Bank Restriction period (1797-1821), but none specifically address the originally expected duration of the suspension.

## Research Priority: HIGH

This is the only remaining [VERIFY] tag in the entire manuscript. Resolving this will complete the fact-checking process and allow the book to proceed to final copyedit and publication.
