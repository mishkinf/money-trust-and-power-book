# Editorial Prompt: Add Missing Human Stories

## OBSERVATION
**Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH | Impact: Emotional Engagement 8.5 → 9.5**

The book has powerful human stories in some chapters but lacks them in others. Adding 3-4 strategic personal narratives will increase emotional resonance.

## MISSING STORIES (Research Needed)

### 1. German Family During Hyperinflation (Chapter 10)
**Where:** 1923 Weimar section
**Why:** Currently explains Weimar intellectually but lacks visceral detail
**What to add:** 300-400 words showing:
- Daily price increases (morning vs afternoon)
- Wages paid twice daily, spent immediately
- Wheelbarrows of currency for bread
- Savings destroyed overnight

**Research status:** ❌ Need to research specific family diary/memoir
**Alternative:** Use documented price data narratively (bread cost in morning vs evening)

### 2. French Worker During Gold Standard Depression (Chapter 10)  
**Where:** 1931-1936 deflation discussion
**Why:** Currently says "young men trying not to die" but doesn't show it
**What to add:** 250-300 words:
- Unemployment in industrial cities
- Wage cuts under deflation
- Political radicalization (communists vs fascists)

**Research status:** ⚠️ Need French sources or secondary accounts
**Alternative:** May not be feasible; skip if research unavailable

### 3. Japanese Worker During Lost Decades (Chapter 13)
**Where:** Japan's 30-year deflation section
**Why:** Currently quantitative (¥400T printed) but not human
**What to add:** 200-250 words:
- Lifetime employment ending
- Salarymen unemployment
- Youth generation with no inflation memory
- Elderly hoarding cash despite zero interest

**Research status:** ⚠️ Need Japanese sources or English accounts
**Alternative:** Use well-documented "lost generation" phenomenon

## RESEARCH REQUIREMENTS

**Feasible from existing sources:**
- German hyperinflation (widely documented in English)
- Japanese deflation (extensive English coverage)

**May require additional research:**
- French 1930s experience (less English documentation)

## IMPLEMENTATION
**Decision rule:** Only add stories where research is already available in @Research folder OR can be quickly verified from major English sources (Eichengreen, Skidelsky, etc.)

**Do NOT:** Invent details or use "representative" fictional characters

**Time estimate:** 4-6 hours research + 3-4 hours writing = 7-10 hours total

## SUCCESS METRIC
Add 2-3 human stories (minimum 600 words total) where research supports them.
