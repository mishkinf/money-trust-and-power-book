## NOTES

**On Markdown Linting:**
The lint warnings (MD022, MD032, MD036) are minor formatting issues about blank lines around headings and lists. They don't affect readability and can be addressed in final formatting. Focus on content quality first.

**On Timeline:**
The 4-6 month timeline assumes dedicated work. Adjust based on:
- Available time per week
- Complexity of research required
- Number of revision rounds needed

**On Flexibility:**
These prompts provide structure, not straitjackets. Adapt as needed while maintaining the core objectives:
1. Make the "great forgetting" prominent
2. Add human stories
3. Integrate contemporary relevance
4. Reduce length strategically
5. Define all terms

---

**Begin with Prompt 10 (Length Reduction) and proceed through the sequence.**
