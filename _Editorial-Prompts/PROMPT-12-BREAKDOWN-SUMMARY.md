# PROMPT-12 Breakdown: Overview

**Date:** December 2024  
**Purpose:** Split PROMPT-12 into manageable, focused sub-prompts

---

## WHY THE BREAKDOWN?

PROMPT-12 originally covered 7 major tasks in one document (~15 hours of work). Some tasks—especially citation verification and consistency audits—need to be done **chapter-by-chapter** due to their intensive, detailed nature. 

By breaking into separate prompts, you can:
- ✅ Track progress more granularly
- ✅ Complete verification work systematically (one chapter at a time)
- ✅ Parallelize some tasks (e.g., transitions can be checked while doing pacing)
- ✅ Have clear completion criteria for each sub-task

---

## THE 5 SUB-PROMPTS

### **PROMPT 12A: Citation & Fact Verification** (Chapter-by-Chapter)
**File:** `PROMPT-12A-Citation-Fact-Verification.md`  
**Time:** 3-4 hours **per chapter** (40-50 hours total for all chapters)  
**Priority:** HIGHEST - Must be done first

**What it covers:**
- Verify every factual claim has a citation or is flagged [VERIFY]
- Check all dates, numbers, names, quotes against sources
- Cross-reference with Research folder
- Ensure no internal research files cited (use root sources)
- Verify Chicago Manual 17th edition style
- Flag anything that seems fabricated or unsourced

**Why chapter-by-chapter:**
- Too detailed to do as one pass
- Each chapter needs 3-4 hours of focused verification
- Need to track completion systematically
- Can't skip chapters or rush through

**Output:** Completion report per chapter documenting issues found, [VERIFY] tags added, citations checked

---

### **PROMPT 12B: Consistency Audit** (Chapter-by-Chapter)
**File:** `PROMPT-12B-Consistency-Audit.md`  
**Time:** 2-3 hours **per chapter** (25-35 hours total)  
**Priority:** HIGH - Do after 12A

**What it covers:**
- Voice consistency ("you" vs "we" vs third person)
- Passive voice reduction
- Sentence length variation (break 70+ word sentences)
- Jargon/terminology definitions verified
- Number/date/currency formatting consistent
- Capitalization rules followed
- British vs American spelling consistent
- Build glossary as you go (20-30 terms total)

**Why chapter-by-chapter:**
- Need to track terminology chapter-by-chapter
- Build glossary incrementally
- Ensure voice consistent within each chapter first, then across book
- Systematic style guide creation

**Output:** Completion report per chapter + running glossary list

---

### **PROMPT 12C: Transitions & Flow** (Cross-Chapter)
**File:** `PROMPT-12C-Transitions-Flow.md`  
**Time:** 3-4 hours total  
**Priority:** MEDIUM - After 12A and 12B

**What it covers:**
- Chapter-to-chapter transitions (read last ¶ Ch N, first ¶ Ch N+1)
- Part transitions (I→II, II→III, III→IV)
- Contemporary opening → historical narrative bridges
- Within-chapter section flow
- Each chapter ending creates momentum for next

**Why cross-chapter:**
- By definition requires reading connections between chapters
- Can be done more efficiently as single focused task
- Not as granular as citation/consistency work

**Output:** Transition quality assessment report with fixes prioritized

---

### **PROMPT 12D: Pacing & Read-Aloud** (Chapter-by-Chapter)
**File:** `PROMPT-12D-Pacing-ReadAloud.md`  
**Time:** 1-2 hours **per chapter** (15-25 hours total)  
**Priority:** MEDIUM - After 12A, 12B, 12C

**What it covers:**
- Read each chapter aloud to catch awkward phrasing
- Identify where attention wanders
- Verify word count 5,500-7,500 per chapter
- Check pacing consistency across chapters
- Mark rhythm problems (too many long/short sentences in row)
- Note repetitive words/phrases

**Why chapter-by-chapter:**
- Must read entire chapter aloud (can't skim)
- Need to compare pacing chapter-to-chapter
- Attention tracking requires focused reading
- Word count verification per chapter

**Output:** Pacing report per chapter with awkward sections marked, word count verified

---

### **PROMPT 12E: Final Polish** (Whole Book)
**File:** `PROMPT-12E-Final-Polish.md`  
**Time:** 4-5 hours total  
**Priority:** FINAL - After all other 12 sub-prompts

**What it covers:**
- Contemporary relevance still current (check all chapter openings)
- Emotional arc complete (all human stories present, suffering→understanding→hope)
- Professional copyedit (spelling, grammar, punctuation)
- Final formatting check (headings, blockquotes, footnotes)
- Manuscript completeness (all parts present, no placeholders)
- Word count verification (90,000-92,000 total)
- [VERIFY] tags all resolved
- Glossary complete (20-30 terms from 12B)
- Bibliography formatted correctly

**Why whole-book:**
- Final holistic pass after detailed work done
- Verification that nothing missed
- Ensures manuscript submission-ready
- Creates final completion report

**Output:** Comprehensive completion report certifying manuscript publication-ready

## KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **Don't rush.** This is intensive, detailed work that determines publication quality.

2. **Do chapters sequentially.** Don't skip around - complete 12A for all chapters before starting 12B.

3. **Document everything.** Create completion reports so you know what's been checked.

4. **Use [VERIFY] tags liberally.** If you can't verify something, flag it. Don't guess.

5. **Take breaks.** Fact-checking and consistency audits are mentally demanding. Do 2-3 chapters per day maximum.

6. **Build as you go.** Create glossary incrementally in 12B. Track style decisions. Document patterns.

7. **Final pass is final.** By the time you reach 12E, no major issues should remain. It's verification, not discovery.

---

## DEPENDENCIES

**Must complete in order:**
- 12A (citations) before 12B (consistency) - need clean text to audit
- 12A, 12B before 12C (transitions) - voice consistency matters for flow
- 12A, 12B, 12C before 12D (pacing) - clean text reads better
- All others before 12E (final polish) - it's the final verification

**Can be parallelized (if multiple people working):**
- 12C (transitions) can be done while 12B (consistency) in progress
- 12D (pacing) can start after 12A done, doesn't need 12B complete

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**After completing all 5 sub-prompts, manuscript should be:**

✅ **Factually verified:** Every claim cited or flagged, zero hallucinations  
✅ **Stylistically consistent:** Voice, jargon, formatting uniform throughout  
✅ **Well-connected:** Smooth transitions chapter-to-chapter and part-to-part  
✅ **Properly paced:** Engaging throughout, appropriate word counts  
✅ **Publication-ready:** Professional polish, zero [VERIFY] flags, complete bibliography

**Final test:** Could be submitted to publisher as-is, expecting only minor copyedit changes.

## NEXT STEPS

1. Review this breakdown to ensure it makes sense
2. Start with PROMPT 12A, Preface (first chapter)
3. Work systematically through chapters
4. Track progress using status matrix
5. Create completion reports as you go
6. Aim for 9.5-10/10 publication-ready manuscript at end

**Estimated completion:** 2-3 weeks of focused full-time work, or 6-8 weeks part-time (10-15 hours/week)
