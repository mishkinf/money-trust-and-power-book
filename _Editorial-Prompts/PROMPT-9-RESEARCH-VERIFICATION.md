- Use verified exchange (Shroff → Bernstein → Robertson)
- Can say "moment was significant" without inventing "silence"
- Can explain WHY moment mattered (dollar becoming reserve currency)

## SECTION 4: CRITICAL FACT-CHECKING NEEDED

### MUST VERIFY Before Using:

**1. British Lend-Lease Debt ($4.7 billion)**
- PROMPT-9 claims: "Britain owed the United States $4.7 billion through Lend-Lease"
- SOURCE NEEDED: Verify this figure before using
- CURRENT CHAPTER: Mentions Lend-Lease but doesn't quantify
- ACTION: Search @Research folder or flag for additional research

**2. British Gold Reserves ($2 billion)**
- PROMPT-9 claims: "British gold reserves stood at $2 billion—barely 10% of American holdings"
- SOURCE NEEDED: Verify this figure
- CURRENT CHAPTER: Doesn't specify British reserves
- ACTION: Check Bretton Woods quantitative data file for UK reserves

**3. US Gold Holdings ($22B of $28B)**
- CURRENT CHAPTER: States this ✅
- Bretton Woods Quantitative Data: Confirms 1944: 18,325 MT = $20.62B ✅
- DISCREPANCY: Chapter says $22B, research says $20.62B
- ACTION: Use $20.6B (more precise) or note 1944 fluctuation

**4. Morgenthau Hotel Seizure Threat**
- CURRENT CHAPTER: Uses this ✅
- Robbins diaries: "get the President to get out an order to seize the hotel" ✅
- Keynes: "throw us out of the hotel" ✅
- STATUS: VERIFIED - can expand on this

**5. Conference Extension (July 19-22)**
- CURRENT CHAPTER: States extended 3 days ✅
- Verification report: Confirms July 1-22 with extension ✅
- STATUS: VERIFIED

---

## SECTION 5: EXPANSION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Verify Missing Numbers (30 min - 1 hour)
BEFORE writing anything:
1. Search @Research for Lend-Lease debt figure
2. Search @Research for British 1944 gold reserves
3. Verify US gold holdings precise figure (Chapter says $22B, data says $20.6B)
4. Create list: VERIFIED / NEEDS EXTERNAL RESEARCH

### Phase 2: Draft Scene-Setting (2 hours)
Using ONLY verified facts:
- 730 delegates, 44 nations ✅
- July 1-22, 1944 ✅
- Mount Washington Hotel ✅
- US: $20.6B gold (80% of global) ✅
- Robbins: "glorious confusion" ✅
- Isolation served American purposes ✅

**Avoid:** Specific hotel details unless found in research

### Phase 3: Expand Keynes Personal Story (2 hours)
Using ONLY verified facts:
- IF Lend-Lease debt verified: Use specific figure
- IF British reserves verified: Use specific figure
- IF NOT verified: Use general language ("Britain owed billions," "British reserves were minimal")
- July 19 heart attack ✅
- "Race between exhaustion and termination" ✅
- December "dotted line" letter ✅
- April 1946 death ✅

### Phase 4: Detail Procedural Death (2 hours)
Using ONLY verified facts:
- Commission I, II, III structure ✅
- April Joint Statement rejected bancor ✅
- May invitation specified IMF only ✅
- Shroff July 13 question ✅
- White's strategy: prevent votes ✅

**Avoid:** 
- ❌ "Late night sessions" (unverified)
- ❌ "Room fell silent" (unverified)
- ❌ Specific procedural tactics beyond documented White strategy

### Phase 5: Integration & Citation (1 hour)
- Insert new sections
- Add proper Chicago citations
- Flag ANY claim that couldn't be verified: [NEEDS VERIFICATION: specific detail]
- Word count check: Target 6,500 ±200

---

## SECTION 6: CITATION STANDARDS

### For Every New Addition:

**Quantitative claim** → Must have footnote with source
- Example: "730 delegates" → footnote to conference proceedings

**Quote** → Must have exact source
- Example: Robbins quote → footnote to Robbins diaries (LSE ROBBINS/6/1/2, July XX, 1944)

**Interpretive claim** → Must be grounded in documented facts
- Example: "Isolation served American purposes" → based on Robbins's documented observations + American control

**Unverified detail** → Must be flagged
- Format: "White may have [specific tactic] [NEEDS VERIFICATION]" OR remove entirely

---

## SECTION 7: FINAL CHECKLIST

---

## NEXT STEP

**IMMEDIATE ACTION:**  
Search @Research folder for:
1. "Lend-Lease" + "Britain" + "debt" → Find precise figure or flag as needing research
2. "British gold reserves" + "1944" → Find precise figure or flag
3. Proceed with expansion using THIS verification report as guide

**RULE:** If a fact isn't in this verification report as ✅ verified, either find it in @Research or flag it as [NEEDS VERIFICATION] in the draft.
