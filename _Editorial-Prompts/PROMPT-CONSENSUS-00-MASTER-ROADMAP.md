## QUALITY STANDARDS FOR ALL REVISIONS

### Voice & Style Consistency

**Before writing any addition, study these exemplars:**

| Element | Study These Sections |
|---------|---------------------|
| Human vignettes | Chapter 7 (Gigney), Chapter 10 (Todd family) |
| Economic explanation | Chapter 5 (money creation), Chapter 11 (Triffin) |
| Transitions | Chapter 3→4, Chapter 9→10 endings |
| Pedagogical clarity | Understanding Checks in Chapters 1, 5, 8, 11 |
| Contemporary parallels | All chapter openings |

**Non-negotiable stylistic elements:**
- Specific dates (not "early 2008" but "February 15, 2008")
- Documented details (not "many suffered" but "1,815 applicants for 3 positions")
- Measured tone (not "shocking revelation" but "instructive pattern")
- Forward/backward references ("as we saw in Chapter X," "we'll return to this")
- Analytical restraint (present evidence, understate conclusions)

### Research & Citation Standards

**Use Research folder FIRST:**
```
/Research/Task 1 Phase 2 Research/
/Research/additional/
/Research/crypto/
/Research/[various files]
```

**For each new factual claim:**
1. Check if source already exists in Research folder
2. If not, identify credible source (government data, academic papers, documentary evidence)
3. Add citation to appropriate `sources.md` file with format:

```markdown
## [Section Name]

[Specific claim or quote]
- [Full citation with author, title, publication, date, page number if applicable]
- [URL if available]
- Accessed [date]
```

**Citation hierarchy (prefer in order):**
1. Primary sources (government records, contemporary documents)
2. Academic papers (peer-reviewed journals)
3. Reputable secondary sources (major newspapers, established authors)
4. Avoid: Wikipedia, blogs, opinion pieces

### Structural Integration Checklist

**After each addition, verify:**

- [ ] **Flow:** Does it read naturally from previous paragraph and into next?
- [ ] **Redundancy:** Are you repeating content from same chapter?
- [ ] **Contradictions:** Does this conflict with earlier/later chapters?
- [ ] **Tone match:** Does voice match surrounding sections?
- [ ] **Length balance:** Does addition make chapter feel overlong or digressive?
- [ ] **Citations:** Are all facts documented in sources.md?

### Testing Your Additions

**For human stories:**
- Could you visualize this scene? (If not, add specific details)
- Do you care about this person? (If not, develop their humanity)
- Does it connect to systemic analysis within ~200 words? (If not, tighten)

**For concept explanations:**
- Could an intelligent non-economist understand this? (If not, simplify)
- Did you define technical terms in context? (If not, add definitions)
- Did you use concrete examples before abstract theory? (If not, reorder)

**For transitions:**
- Can you summarize "why previous chapter mattered" from this bridge? (If not, strengthen)
- Does it create anticipation for next chapter? (If not, add forward reference)
- Is it under 400 words? (If not, this is a section, not a transition—cut)

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### Manuscript Statistics (Post-Revision)

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Total words | 82,597 | ~87,500 | +4,900 |
| Chapter 13 | ~6,500 | ~8,200 | +1,700 |
| Part IV flow | Rushed | Deliberate | Qualitative |
| Concept clarity | Late arrival | Progressive | Qualitative |
| Part III polish | Minor redundancy | Tightened | -300 words |

### Reader Experience Improvements

**Before revisions:**
- Part IV feels rushed vs. Part III depth
- Chapter 13 payoff underwhelming given build-up
- Key concepts (productive capacity, Triffin) arrive suddenly
- Minor confusion at Part IV chapter transitions

**After revisions:**
- Part IV pacing matches Part III's deliberate rhythm
- Chapter 13 delivers substantial payoff with emotional + analytical weight
- Concepts develop progressively (seed → preview → full explanation)
- Clear signposting prevents disorientation at transitions

### Commercial Positioning

**These revisions strengthen:**
- **Academic credibility:** More rigorous concept development
- **Trade accessibility:** Better pedagogical scaffolding
- **Narrative satisfaction:** Stronger emotional arc in Part IV
- **Review potential:** Critics less likely to cite "rushed conclusion"

**Without compromising:**
- Current manuscript's strengths (voice, research, human stories)
- Length (stays within 87-90K word trade sweet spot)
- Timeline (15-20 hours is ~2-3 weeks at 1 hour/day pace)

---

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

### What These Prompts ARE:
- Specific, actionable additions with placement guidance
- Research direction using existing `/Research` folder
- Voice/tone examples from existing manuscript
- Quality checklists ensuring consistency

### What These Prompts ARE NOT:
- Complete rewrites (manuscript is publication-ready with refinement)
- Stylistic overhauls (voice is excellent, maintain it)
- Thesis changes (argument is sound, just needs fuller development)
- Endless expansion (target is focused: +5K words maximum)

### Success Criteria

**You'll know revisions succeed when:**

1. **Beta reader can summarize Part IV arc** without your prompting:
   - "Gold failed → Bretton Woods tried but flawed → Nixon ended gold → 2008 proved fiat works"

2. **Technical sections feel challenging but comprehensible:**
   - Reader thinks: "This is complex but I'm following it"
   - Not: "I'm lost and skimming until it gets clearer"

3. **Chapter 13 feels like earned conclusion:**
   - Reader thinks: "This 5,000-year journey was worth it—I understand money differently now"
   - Not: "That ending felt abrupt for such a long build-up"

4. **Concepts develop naturally:**
   - Reader thinks: "Oh good, now I'm finally getting the full explanation of that productive capacity thing"
   - Not: "Where did this 'productive capacity' concept suddenly come from?"

---

## FINAL INTEGRATION VERIFICATION

### After completing all revisions:

1. **Read Part IV (Chapters 10-13) straight through without pause**
   - Time yourself: Should take ~90-120 minutes at normal reading speed
   - Track your experience: Do you feel oriented? Engaged? Satisfied at ending?

2. **Test concept development arc:**
   - Chapter 1: Productive capacity previewed?
   - Chapter 5: Output gap defined?
   - Chapter 10: Triffin dilemma foreshadowed?
   - Chapter 11: Triffin dilemma explained fully?
   - Chapter 13: Productive capacity examined in depth?
   - **Does this feel like progressive development or repetitive redundancy?**

3. **Verify no contradictions:**
   - Do statistics match across chapters? (E.g., 2008 unemployment cited in Ch 1 and Ch 13)
   - Do forward references deliver? (If Ch 10 says "we'll examine Triffin in detail," does Ch 11 do so?)
   - Do dates align? (Historical timeline consistent throughout?)

4. **Word count verification:**
   - Total manuscript: 87,000-90,000 words? (If outside range, trim or expand as needed)
   - Chapter 13: 8,000-8,500 words? (If under, expand further; if over, tighten)
   - Individual additions: Within specified ranges per prompt?

5. **Citation audit:**
   - Every new statistic in sources.md?
   - Every human story documented with source?
   - Economic data includes source + date?
   - No "it's widely known that..." unsourced claims?

## MAINTAINING PERSPECTIVE

### What Makes This Manuscript Exceptional (Don't Change)

- **Original thesis:** 5,000-year historical proof of chartalist money theory
- **Narrative craft:** Human stories ground abstract economics
- **Contemporary relevance:** Every chapter opens with modern parallel
- **Scholarly rigor:** Documented sources, primary research, no speculation
- **Accessible voice:** Complex ideas explained without condescension
- **Structural coherence:** Four-part arc builds logically to conclusion

### What These Revisions Accomplish

These are **refinements**, not repairs. The manuscript is already publication-ready. These revisions:
- Strengthen the ending to match the excellent opening
- Improve pacing consistency across all four parts
- Reduce cognitive friction at critical concept introductions
- Eliminate minor redundancy in Part III

**The book was already A-minus. These revisions push it to A/A-plus.**

## QUESTIONS & TROUBLESHOOTING

**Q: What if I can't find research materials in `/Research` folder?**  
A: Note what's needed in the prompt file, conduct targeted search, cite properly in sources.md. Prioritize government data and academic sources.

**Q: What if an addition disrupts the flow?**  
A: Read aloud. If it feels jarring, it probably is—revise transition sentences before/after addition to create smoother integration.

**Q: What if I'm unsure about voice/tone match?**  
A: Find analogous section in existing manuscript (human story? concept explanation? transition?), study its style, imitate its patterns.

**Q: What if word count exceeds target?**  
A: Each addition has maximum word count for reason. If over, tighten. Exception: If Chapter 13 exceeds 8,500 words slightly because human story demands it, that's acceptable.

**Q: Should I complete all prompts?**  
A: Tier 1 (Prompts 05, 06) are critical—complete these first. Tier 2 (Prompts 07, 04) are important—complete if time allows. Tier 3 is optional enhancements.

**Q: How do I know when I'm done?**  
A: When you can read Part IV without feeling rushed, Chapter 13 without feeling unsatisfied, and concepts develop without feeling sudden. Trust your instincts as intelligent reader.
