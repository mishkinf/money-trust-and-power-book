### Priority 1: German Hyperinflation - **OUTSTANDING SUCCESS**

**Implementation Target:** Chapter 10 (Weimar section)  
**Suggested Word Count:** 300-350 words

### Priority 2: Japanese Lost Decades - **GOOD SUCCESS**

**Individual:** Kono (surname only)  
**Documentation Quality:** MEDIUM (B+)  
**Source:** Bloomberg Businessweek 2020 feature article

**Why This Works:**
- Real person (name partially disclosed per Japanese privacy norms)
- **3 specific documented impacts** with clear monetary policy connection
- Represents "Employment Ice Age Generation" (1993-2004 graduates)
- Contemporary relevance: story from 2019-2020
- Emblematic of deflation's psychological scarring

**Key Details:**
- Mid-40s, graduated university during employment ice age (late 1990s-mid 2000s)
- Became hikikomori (socially withdrawn), lived with parents 15+ years
- Accumulated ¥3 million ($28,400) in debt with zero employment
- 2019: Applied for 1 of 3 government jobs, competed with 1,815 others (605:1 ratio)
- Quote: "It was in the employment ice age. I thought even if I tried, it would be in vain."

**Methodological Note Required:**
"Name partially disclosed in journalism following Japanese privacy practices for sensitive personal subjects. Full biographical details limited but core facts documented in Bloomberg feature."

**Implementation Target:** Chapter 13 (Japan deflation section)  
**Suggested Word Count:** 250-300 words

### Priority 3: French Depression Worker - **ACCEPTABLE SUCCESS**

**Individual:** Morvan Lebesque  
**Documentation Quality:** MEDIUM (B)  
**Source:** Multiple French biographical sources + his own testimony (original publication unverified)

**Why This Works:**
- Full biographical details confirmed (born 1911, died 1970)
- **Personal unemployment confirmed** - not just observer but participant
- Powerful first-person testimony of winter 1932-33
- Later became prominent journalist/writer, giving credibility
- Represents educated young workers hit by Depression

**Key Details:**
- Age 21-22 during winter 1932-33
- Former editor-in-chief of *Loire Echo* (Nantes) at age 19
- Moved to Paris 1932, "struggled to find stable employment"
- "Multiple odd jobs in commerce" - significant downward mobility
- Testimony: "The winter I spent on the streets...thousands of young men...trying not to die"
- Survived, became cultural critic at *Le Canard Enchaîné*

**Complication to Note:**
- Original source of winter 1932-33 quote not located (widely cited but unattributed)
- Later worked for collaborationist press during Nazi occupation (1940s)
- Suggest acknowledging: "Quote widely cited; original publication requires French archival research"

**Implementation Target:** Chapter 10 (French gold standard depression section)  
**Suggested Word Count:** 250-300 words

## Overall Assessment

**SUCCESS RATE: 3/3 (100%)**

All three priority stories from PROMPT-11 now have documented named individuals:
- ✅ German hyperinflation: FULLY ACHIEVED (outstanding quality)
- ✅ Japanese Lost Decades: SUBSTANTIALLY ACHIEVED (good quality)
- ✅ French Depression: ACCEPTABLY ACHIEVED (usable with notes)

**TOTAL NEW CONTENT:** 800-950 words (3 stories × 250-350 words each)

This **exceeds PROMPT-11 success metric** of "2-3 human stories (minimum 600 words total)"

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Write Three Narratives ⏳

Using the suggested narrative structures from research file:

1. **Victor Klemperer narrative** (300-350 words)
   - Open with Eva's coffee shop price doubling
   - Build through October diary entries
   - Peak with November 2.5 trillion mark entry
   - Close with survival and later Nazi period reference

2. **Kono narrative** (250-300 words)
   - Open with 2019 scene: 1,815 applicants for 3 jobs
   - Flashback to university during employment ice age
   - Document hikikomori period and ¥3M debt
   - Close with "8050 problem" and policy failure

3. **Morvan Lebesque narrative** (250-300 words)
   - Open with metro entrance, winter 1933
   - Establish his credentials: former editor at age 19
   - Present his testimony of street life
   - Note survival and later career

### Step 2: Identify Chapter Integration Points 🔍

Need to find where in each chapter these stories should be inserted:

- **Chapter 10:** Weimar section needs Klemperer, French section needs Lebesque
- **Chapter 13:** Japan deflation section needs Kono

### Step 3: Integration Strategy 📝

Two options:
- **Option A:** Insert as standalone 300-word vignettes with separators
- **Option B:** Weave into existing narrative flow, breaking up economics with human impact

### Step 4: Citation Implementation 📚

Add footnotes/endnotes with Chicago-style citations from research file

## Next Actions for YOU

**Decision needed:**

1. **Should I write the three narratives now?**
   - I'll use the suggested structures from research file
   - Polish for emotional impact and clarity
   - Include proper methodological notes (especially for Kono and Lebesque)

2. **Should I identify specific insertion points in chapters?**
   - I'll need to read Chapter 10 and Chapter 13
   - Find natural breaks in economic exposition
   - Suggest exactly where each story fits

3. **Integration style preference?**
   - Standalone vignettes with visual breaks (easier to implement)
   - Woven into narrative flow (more elegant but requires more restructuring)

**My recommendation:** Let me write all three narratives first (1-2 hours), then we'll review them before integrating into chapters. This way you can approve the content before we modify existing chapter text.

**Sound good?**
