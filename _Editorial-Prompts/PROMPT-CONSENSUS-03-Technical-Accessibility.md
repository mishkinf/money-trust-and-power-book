# EDITORIAL PROMPT: Technical Accessibility & Visual Aids (Target: 9/10)

## Current Status
- **Impact on Rating**: HIGH — both evaluations identify technical passages as barriers
- **Solution**: Add 5-8 visual/pedagogical aids to make abstract processes concrete
- **Current Strengths**: Contemporary hooks, human stories, "Understanding Check" boxes
- **Missing**: Visual aids that make processes immediately graspable

## Core Problem

Both evaluators note: "Some concepts could overwhelm lay readers despite excellent scaffolding."

**Target**: Smart general readers who grasp concepts better with visual anchors (*Economist*/*FT* infographic quality).

## High-Priority Visual Aids to Add

### 1. Chapter 5: "How Banks Create Money" — Flowchart
**Location**: After Thomas Fletcher example
**Shows**: Double-entry bookkeeping creating money from lending
**Impact**: Makes most difficult concept in book visually clear

### 2. Chapter 9: "Notes vs. Deposits" — Side-by-Side Table
**Location**: After Peel's tragic error section  
**Shows**: What Bank Charter Act regulated (notes) vs. what it missed (deposits)
**Impact**: Visually demonstrates regulatory failure

### 3. Chapter 13: "Real Resources Constraint" — Enhanced Analogy
**Location**: Productive capacity section
**Shows**: Concert hall (seats = goods, tickets = money) in recession vs. full capacity
**Impact**: Makes abstract principle intuitive

### 4. Chapter 11: "Bretton Woods Power Structure" — System Map
**Location**: After White's procedural control
**Shows**: Dollar at center, other currencies pegged to it, U.S. gold backing
**Impact**: Visualizes power asymmetry

### 5. Timeline: "Money's 5,000-Year Evolution"
**Location**: Preface or Epilogue
**Shows**: Credit money 4,746 years, gold standard 254 years (5% of history)
**Impact**: Crystallizes book's core thesis visually

## Implementation Checklist

### Must-Add (Highest Impact)
- [ ] Ch 5: Bank lending creates money flowchart
- [ ] Ch 9: Notes vs. deposits comparison table
- [ ] Ch 13: Enhanced concert hall diagram
- [ ] Ch 11: Bretton Woods system map

### Strongly Recommended
- [ ] Timeline infographic (Preface or Epilogue)
- [ ] Ch 6: Gold standard adjustment mechanism flowchart
- [ ] Add 2-3 more "Understanding Check" boxes in densest sections

### Production Notes
- Start with ASCII/text diagrams for manuscript
- Designer can enhance for publication
- Every visual must clarify specific conceptual stumbling block

## Expected Impact

**Comprehension**: Technical sections become accessible to general readers
**Confidence**: Readers trust they understand complex processes
**Rating Boost**: From 8-8.5/10 → 9/10+

**High-leverage fix**: Small additions (~5-8 visuals) dramatically improve accessibility without diluting intellectual rigor.
