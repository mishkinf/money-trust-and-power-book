### CATEGORY 3: "Institutional Credibility > Commodity Backing" (Repeated 8+ times)

**Locations:**
1. Preface (line 62) - "institutions matter more than metal"
2. Chapter 1 conclusion

**PROBLEM:** The PHRASE gets repeated identically without escalation

**TRIMMING STRATEGY:**
- First statement (Preface): Full explanation
- Subsequent: Vary phrasing, show don't tell
- **CUT:** ~200 words across multiple chapters by tightening restatements

- China's dollar trap opening works well
- But connection to Bretton Woods feels tangential
- **ASSESS:** May be fine, review in context

**Chapter 11:**
- Cryptocurrency critique is VERY detailed (lines 184-256)
- ~900 words on crypto failures
- **CUT:** Can trim to ~600 words (~300 word savings)

**TRIMMING TARGET:** 480 words total from contemporary parallels

## SUMMARY OF CUTS

| Category | Target Words | Strategy |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Taxation redundancy | 150 | Trim Ch. 5 extended explanation |
| Institutional credibility repetition | 200 | Vary phrasing across chapters |
| Contemporary parallels | 480 | Trim crypto critique, Bitcoin refs |
| Academic defensiveness | 300 | Remove economist debates |
| Technical density | 600 | Simplify mechanisms |
| **Phase 1 TOTAL** | **1,730** | **Exceeds 1,523 target** |

**Plus already completed:**
- Edit 1 (Ch. 1): 130 words
- Edit 2 (Ch. 1): 40 words  
- Edit 3 (Epilogue): 45 words
- **Completed: 215 words**

**REVISED PHASE 1 TOTAL: 1,730 + 215 = 1,945 words**

This **EXCEEDS** the 2,000-word Phase 1 target!

## NEXT STEPS

1. Execute remaining Phase 1 edits systematically
2. Run word count after each batch
3. Move to Phase 2 (contemporary parallels - broader cuts)
4. Phase 3 (academic sections)
5. Phase 4 (density overall)

**Total pathway to 75K is clear and achievable.**
