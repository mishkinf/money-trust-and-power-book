## WHAT WAS ADDED

### 1. Enhanced Scene-Setting (+800 words)
**Location:** Lines 23-49

**Added details:**
- Mount Washington Hotel atmosphere with Robbins's "glorious confusion" quote
- Strategic isolation explanation (mail slow, calls monitored, no government consultation)
- Power asymmetry with precise figures ($20.6B US gold vs Britain's crushing debts)
- Robbins quote: "We know we will be beaten and we hope to avoid being humiliated"
- Character introductions: Keynes (61, declining health) vs White (52, methodical, controlling)
- White's candid admission about Fort Knox gold giving US "enviable position"

### 2. Expanded Keynes Character Development (+600 words)
**Location:** Lines 39-47, 329-359

**Added depth:**
- Keynes's previous heart attack and deteriorating health
- His belief that intellectual force could still matter despite Britain's bankruptcy
- Physical description: "watching that hope die with each passing day"
- Marathon negotiating sessions, altitude stress, exhaustion
- Robbins watching Keynes deteriorate: "race between exhaustion and termination"
- July 19 heart attack on hotel stairs, German obituaries
- Conference extended 3 days forcing medically compromised British delegation to continue
- Post-Bretton Woods loan negotiations as "absolute hell"
- Savannah March 1946: "I went to meet the world, and all I met was a tyrant"
- Death April 1946, age 62, attributed to exhaustion

### 3. Detailed Procedural Death of Bancor (+900 words)
**Location:** Lines 71-99

**Added timeline:**
- **April 21, 1944:** Joint Statement already reflected White's IMF, bancor gone
- **May 25, 1944:** US invitation specified "IMF" only, no mention of ICU
- **June 15-30, 1944:** Atlantic City pre-conference finalized US-drafted documents
- **July 1, 1944:** Commission structure assigned White to Fund, Keynes to Bank
- Detailed explanation of how working groups discussed "how" not "whether"
- Why smaller nations supported (dollar shortages, reconstruction needs, power realities)
- Latin American delegate admission of instructions to vote with US

### 4. Expanded July 13 Shroff Moment (+400 words)
**Location:** Lines 101-121

**Added context:**
- Setting: Commission I session, IMF Articles discussion
- What Shroff was really asking (sterling vs dollar as reserve)
- Bernstein's evasive "easier for this purpose" language
- Why Robertson (British) enshrined dollar dominance in text
- India-Britain fracture: India seeking protection from sterling weakness
- £1.3B sterling balances Britain owed to colonies
- "Capitulation dressed as pragmatism"
- Profound irony: British delegate enacted American preference

### 5. Expanded White's Procedural Control (+250 words)
**Location:** Lines 55-69

**Added mechanics:**
- White's explicit strategy statement to Morgenthau
- How he controlled: speaker recognition, time allocation, vote timing
- Physical exhaustion as control mechanism
- Conference sessions morning to night, documents requiring evening review
- "Glorious confusion" served American purposes
- Exhausted delegates made fewer objections, signed faster

### 6. Expanded "Why America Chose Dollar Standard" (+600 words)
**Location:** Lines 251-297

**Added detail:**
- Four explicit advantages broken out with explanations:
  1. Seigniorage profits (interest-free loans from reserve holders)
  2. Monetary autonomy (others adjust to Fed, not vice versa)
  3. Political leverage (sanctions, SWIFT, dollar access as weapon)
  4. Veto power (weighted IMF voting)
- What bancor would have cost: all four advantages eliminated
- White's "absolutely no" on surplus penalties
- What America sacrificed: stable system, Triffin prevention, multilateralism
- Cold-blooded calculation: 27 years worth the crisis
- Final line: "Keynes had bet on reason defeating power. He lost."

### 7. Expanded "What the World Lost" Conclusion (+300 words)
**Location:** Lines 393-417

**Added perspective:**
- What bancor rejection meant: no genuinely multilateral system
- Why system worked 1946-1971: wasn't tested, discipline maintained
- Crossover point 1964: system survived on confidence alone
- France calling America's bluff with de Gaulle
- Tragic irony: choice was conscious, understood consequences
- Modern relevance: China's trap, EMU, emerging market crises, crypto debates
- All trace back to 1944 when gold gave US leverage
- Final: "Keynes bet that reason would defeat power. He lost. But he was right about the consequences."
