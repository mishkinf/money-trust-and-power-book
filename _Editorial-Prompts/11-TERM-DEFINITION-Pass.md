# PROMPT 11: TERM DEFINITION PASS

## Objective

Define all technical terms at first use with clear, accessible language. Eliminate the accessibility barrier created by undefined jargon and assumed knowledge.

## The Core Problem

The manuscript uses technical terms before defining them, assuming readers will understand from context. This creates confusion and frustration for general readers.

**Examples of undefined terms:**
- "Specie" (Ch 2, line 17)
- "Fiscal capacity" (Ch 3, line 50)
- "Sterilizing gold inflows" (Ch 9, line 46)
- "Procyclical policy" (Ch 7, line 97)
- "Endogenous money creation"
- "Reserve ratio"
- "Convertibility"

## Definition Strategy

**For each technical term:**

1. **Define at first use** - Never use a term before defining it
2. **Use simple language** - Explain in terms a smart general reader understands
3. **Provide context** - Show why the term matters
4. **Use examples** - Make abstract concepts concrete

## Definition Patterns

### PATTERN 1: Inline Definition (Preferred)

**Format:** "Term—definition—example"

**Example:**
"The Bank maintained convertibility—the ability to exchange notes for gold on demand—by keeping sufficient reserves."

**Use when:** Term is straightforward, definition is brief

---

### PATTERN 2: Explanatory Sentence

**Format:** Introduce term, then explain in next sentence

**Example:**
"The Federal Reserve sterilized gold inflows. This means it prevented incoming gold from creating new money, hoarding the metal while the rest of the world deflated."

**Use when:** Definition needs more explanation

---

### PATTERN 3: Contextual Introduction

**Format:** Explain concept before introducing technical term

**Example:**
"When gold flowed into America, the Federal Reserve should have allowed the money supply to expand. Instead, it prevented the gold from creating new money—a practice called 'sterilizing' gold inflows."

**Use when:** Concept is complex or counterintuitive

---

## Terms Requiring Definition

### CHAPTER 3: The Sovereign's Dilemma

**Location:** Chapter 5, lines 25-75

---

### CHAPTER 6-7: Gold Standard Era

**Terms to define:**
- **Gold points:** "The exchange rate limits at which it becomes profitable to ship physical gold rather than use paper money"
- **Bank Rate:** "The interest rate the Bank of England charges, which influences all other interest rates in the economy"
- **Reserve ratio:** "The percentage of deposits or notes backed by gold reserves"
- **Suspension of convertibility:** "Temporarily ending the ability to exchange paper money for gold"
- **Bullionist:** "Someone who believes paper money should be strictly limited by gold reserves"

**Location:** Define at first use

---

### CHAPTER 8: Battle for Monetary Truth

**Terms to define:**
- **Currency School:** "Economists who believed money supply should be rigidly tied to gold reserves"
- **Banking School:** "Economists who believed money supply should adjust to economic needs"
- **Real Bills Doctrine:** "The theory that banks should only lend against real commercial transactions, not speculation"
- **Quantity Theory of Money:** "The idea that prices rise proportionally with money supply"
- **Say's Law:** "The claim that supply creates its own demand, making general gluts impossible"

**Location:** Lines 20-60

---

### CHAPTER 9-11: Modern Era

**Terms to define:**
- **Sterilizing gold inflows:** "Preventing incoming gold from creating new money"
- **Procyclical policy:** "Policy that amplifies economic cycles—tightening during recessions, loosening during booms"
- **Quantitative easing (QE):** "Central banks creating money to buy assets, injecting money directly into the economy"
- **Output gap:** "The difference between actual economic production and potential production"
- **Productive capacity:** "The economy's ability to produce goods and services with available labor, capital, and technology"
- **Fiat money:** "Money backed by government decree and trust, not by commodity reserves"

**Location:** Define at first use

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### STEP 1: Identify All Technical Terms
Go through manuscript and highlight every term that:
- A college-educated non-economist might not know
- Has a specific technical meaning different from common usage
- Is essential to understanding the argument

### STEP 2: Define at First Use
For each term:
- Find first occurrence
- Add definition using one of the three patterns
- Verify definition is clear and accurate

### STEP 3: Create Glossary (Optional)
Consider adding glossary at end of book with:
- All technical terms
- Clear definitions
- Page reference to first use

### STEP 4: Consistency Check
Ensure:
- Terms defined before used
- Definitions consistent throughout
- Same term not defined multiple times
- Definitions appropriate for target audience

---

## Quality Checks

After completing term definition pass:

✓ Can a smart general reader understand every term?
✓ Are definitions clear without being condescending?
✓ Do definitions use examples and analogies?
✓ Are terms defined before being used?
✓ Is technical vocabulary minimized?
✓ Would you understand this without economics background?

---

## Expected Outcome

Readers should:
- Never encounter undefined jargon
- Understand technical concepts through clear explanations
- Feel the book is accessible, not intimidating
- Learn economic terminology naturally through context
- Be able to follow arguments without confusion

Not:
- Struggle with undefined terms
- Need to look things up
- Feel lost in technical detail
- Skip sections because they're too complex
