## REMAINING STYLISTIC LINTS (NOT CRITICAL)

### MD036 - Bold emphasis instead of headings
- **Locations:** 20 instances throughout chapter
- **Issue:** Uses `**Bold Text**` for subsection breaks instead of `### Headings`
- **Assessment:** Intentional stylistic choice, consistent with other prompts
- **Action:** No change needed - this is the book's established style

### MD029 - Non-sequential source numbering
- **Locations:** Sources section (43, 49a, 49b, etc.)
- **Issue:** Not 1, 2, 3... sequential
- **Assessment:** Intentional - maintains consistency with existing citation system
- **Action:** No change needed - functional numbering system

### MD034 - Bare URLs in citations
- **Locations:** 6 instances in sources section
- **Issue:** URLs not in `<>` brackets
- **Assessment:** Standard academic citation format, URLs are functional
- **Action:** Optional cleanup, not critical for book quality

### MD032 - Lists in audit file
- **Locations:** CHAPTER-11-CITATION-AUDIT.md
- **Issue:** Missing blank lines around lists
- **Assessment:** Internal working document, not part of book manuscript
- **Action:** No impact on book quality

## CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT

### Chapter 11 Citation Quality: **9.5/10**

**Strengths:**
- Every major claim backed by authoritative source
- Primary sources (FRUS, Robbins diaries, conference proceedings)
- Peer-reviewed secondary sources (Steil, Skidelsky, Naef)
- Numerical data verified from official sources
- Contemporary context properly cited
- No speculation or unverified claims

**Minor limitations (addressed):**
- British reserve estimate uses bracketing (Nov 1943 + Dec 1945) - this is standard practice when precise monthly data unavailable

**Overall:** Chapter meets scholarly standards for trade nonfiction. All major claims verifiable, sources accessible, methodology transparent.
