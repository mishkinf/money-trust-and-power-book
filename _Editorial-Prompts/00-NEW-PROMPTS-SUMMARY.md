# New Editorial Prompts - Summary

Based on the comprehensive developmental editorial evaluation, I've created 4 new prompts addressing the manuscript's most critical improvement opportunities. These prompts focus on weaknesses that would prevent the book from achieving 9.5/10+ ratings in key areas.

## NEW PROMPTS CREATED

### PROMPT-6: Bridge Historical Gaps ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL
**File:** `PROMPT-6-Bridge-Historical-Gaps.md`  
**Addresses:** 81-year chronological gap between Chapter 8 (1844) and Chapter 9 (1925)  
**Current Rating:** Narrative Arc 8.5/10  
**Target Rating:** 9.5/10

**Why this matters:**
Readers finish Chapter 8 understanding gold standard was accidental, then suddenly find themselves in 1925 with the entire world on gold standard. The gap leaves readers confused about how local British phenomenon became global orthodoxy.

**What to add:** 200-400 words explaining gold standard globalization 1870-1914
- Germany adopts gold (1871)
- Global adoption cascade
- Creation of integrated system that made 1930s catastrophe inevitable

**Impact:** Transforms Part III → Part IV transition from jarring leap to logical progression

### PROMPT-7: Enhance Technical Accessibility ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
**File:** `PROMPT-7-Enhance-Technical-Accessibility.md`  
**Addresses:** Integration between technical content and reader support features  
**Current Rating:** Accessibility 8/10  
**Target Rating:** 9.5/10

**Why this matters:**
The manuscript has excellent support materials (glossary, analogies, scaffolding), but general readers don't always realize they exist or how to use them.

**What to enhance:**
- Bold first use of glossary terms (signals "defined elsewhere")
- Add 2-3 "comprehension checkpoints" in Chapter 5 (normalizes confusion)
- Create "Key Concepts" boxes for technical chapters
- Add "Using This Book's Learning Aids" guide

**Impact:** Reduces abandonment due to technical overwhelm, broadens audience

### PROMPT-8: Create MMT Framework Appendix ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
**File:** `PROMPT-8-Create-MMT-Framework-Appendix.md`  
**Addresses:** MMT mentioned throughout but never systematically organized  
**Current Rating:** Conceptual Foundation 9.5/10  
**Target Rating:** 10/10

**Why this matters:**
Policy-focused readers and skeptics want to understand MMT as complete framework, but currently must piece together insights from multiple chapters.

**What to create:** 1,500-2,000 word appendix after Epilogue
- Organize MMT's 5 core principles with historical evidence
- Address common criticisms using manuscript's evidence
- Show MMT as description (not prescription)
- Position as capstone synthesis

**Impact:** Academic adoption increases, serves as MMT primer showing 5,000-year validation

### PROMPT-9: Strengthen International Perspectives ⭐⭐⭐ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**File:** `PROMPT-9-Strengthen-International-Perspectives.md`  
**Addresses:** Anglo-American focus (~85% of examples)  
**Current Rating:** Market Appeal 8.5/10  
**Target Rating:** 9.5/10

**Why this matters:**
International readers want to see pattern validated beyond Britain/US. Comparative analysis strengthens theoretical claims and improves international sales.

**What to add:** 1,000-1,500 words total across existing chapters
- Japanese deflation as modern gold standard analog (Ch11)
- Chinese historical monetary innovation (Ch1-2)
- African colonial taxation coercion (Ch8)
- Latin American currency sovereignty contrasts (Ch11/Epilogue)

**Impact:** Demonstrates chartalism is universal monetary reality, not Anglo-American peculiarity

## FORMATTING NOTE

The new prompt files have minor markdown linting warnings (missing blank lines around headings/lists). These are purely cosmetic and don't affect content. They can be fixed with a formatting pass if desired, but the prompts are fully functional as-is.

## HOW TO USE THESE PROMPTS

Each prompt follows the established format:
1. **OBSERVATION** - What's the issue and why it matters
2. **GOAL** - What success looks like
3. **Specific recommendations** - Where and how to improve (without prescribing exact changes)
4. **Implementation guidance** - How to approach the work
5. **What to preserve** - Important elements not to lose
6. **Success metrics** - How to know it worked

The prompts explain **principles and patterns** rather than **specific edits**, allowing you to find the best implementation while maintaining authorial voice and narrative flow.
