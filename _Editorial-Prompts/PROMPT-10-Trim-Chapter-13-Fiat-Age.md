# Editorial Prompt: Trim Chapter 13 to 7,500 Words

## OBSERVATION
**Current: 9,984 words (54% over target) | Target: 7,500 words | Cut: ~2,500 words**

Chapter 13 has excellent content but is too long. Main issues:
1. CBDC section duplicates Epilogue content
2. Hyperinflation comparison too detailed (7 cases when 4 would suffice)
3. "Productive capacity" concept explained multiple times
4. Crypto critique could be tighter

## GOAL
Reduce from 9,984 → 7,500 words while preserving:
- 2008 crisis validation of fiat
- Productive capacity as real constraint
- Japan's 30-year QE as decisive proof
- COVID stimulus evidence

## WHERE TO CUT (Specific Targets)

### 1. Delete CBDC Section (−800 words)
**Location:** Likely lines 250-310
**Action:** Remove entirely - Epilogue covers this
**Rationale:** Chapter 13 = historical validation. CBDC = future speculation. Belongs in Epilogue only.

### 2. Trim Hyperinflation Table (−500 words)
**Keep:** Weimar, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Japan (4 cases)
**Cut:** Hungary, Yugoslavia, Argentina (redundant patterns)
**Strategy:** Explain mechanism once, use examples as evidence

### 3. Tighten Crypto Section (−400 words)
**Keep:** "Crypto replicates gold's errors" + Terra/Luna example
**Cut:** Blockchain technical details, multiple examples, speculation

### 4. Tighten 1970s Inflation (−300 words)
**Keep:** Supply shock → wage-price spiral → Volcker recession mechanism
**Cut:** Detailed timeline, Phillips Curve technicalities

### 5. Consolidate Productive Capacity Explanations (−500 words)
**Current:** Explained 3+ times throughout chapter
**Revised:** Explain once comprehensively, then reference

✅ `Volcker Recession Victim.md` - add human story if space allows
✅ Multiple 2008 crisis files - already cited

## IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
1. Remove CBDC section (30 min)
2. Trim hyperinflation to 4 cases (2 hrs)
3. Tighten crypto section (1.5 hrs)
4. Consolidate productive capacity (2 hrs)
5. Final review for 7,500 words (1 hr)

**Total time: 7-8 hours**

## SUCCESS METRICS
- Word count: 7,500 ±200
- All core arguments preserved
- No redundancy
- Smoother pacing
- Chapter 13 rating: 8/10 → 9/10
