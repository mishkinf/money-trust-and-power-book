# Editorial Prompt: Strengthen Emotional Engagement in Chapters 7-8

## OBSERVATION
**Current Rating: Reader Engagement 8/10**  
**Target Rating: 9/10**

Chapters 7-8 arrive after the drama of Bank of England's founding (Ch 5) and before the catastrophe of the Great Depression (Ch 9). This middle section handles crucial intellectual history but risks feeling like an "eat your vegetables" interlude between exciting chapters.

**Reader attention most likely to flag:** Mid-Chapter 7 through mid-Chapter 8 (approximately 12,000 words of dense material on Bank Restriction mechanics and intellectual debates).

## GOAL
Increase human story presence and emotional stakes in these chapters without sacrificing intellectual rigor. Make readers FEEL why these debates mattered.

## SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Chapter 7: Amplify Human Cost of 1821 Deflation
**Current:** Samuel Gigney bankruptcy example (strong)

**Enhancement opportunity:**  
Add 2-3 more vivid details showing cascading effects:
- Specific family forced to workhouse
- Shop closure in specific town
- Soldier returning from Waterloo to find farm foreclosed

**Model:** Chapter 9's Harry Todd family story—make deflation viscerally real.

### Chapter 8: Personalize Thomas Attwood
**Current:** Attwood presented as intellectual figure

**Enhancement opportunity:**  
Add personal stakes—was he scorned by establishment? Did he witness suffering that radicalized him? What did marginalization cost him personally?

Make readers ROOT for Attwood as orthodoxy crushes him. This transforms abstract intellectual debate into human drama.

### Both Chapters: Frame as Detective Story
**Reframe:** "How did truth get buried?" = mystery to solve

Use language that creates suspense:
- "Few noticed at the time..."
- "The clues were there, but..."
- "Only decades later would..."

## SUCCESS METRICS
Beta readers should report these chapters as "engrossing" not "necessary." If someone says "I had to push through 7-8," this hasn't worked.
