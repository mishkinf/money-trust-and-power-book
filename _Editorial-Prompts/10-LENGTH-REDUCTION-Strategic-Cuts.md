# PROMPT 10: LENGTH REDUCTION - STRATEGIC CUTS

## Objective

Reduce manuscript length by 15-20% (from approximately 100,000-110,000 words to 80,000-85,000 words) through strategic cuts that improve pacing without sacrificing argument or clarity.

## The Core Problem

The manuscript is too long for optimal trade publication pacing. Major publishers prefer 80,000-90,000 words for narrative nonfiction. Current length creates:
- Pacing problems (readers lose momentum)
- Higher production costs
- Intimidation factor for general readers
- Difficulty maintaining consistent quality

## Cutting Philosophy

**CUT:**
- Redundancy between preface, part intros, and chapter content
- Excessive technical detail that interrupts narrative
- Tangential examples that don't advance argument
- Over-explanation of concepts readers can infer
- Academic hedging and qualification

**KEEP:**
- All human vignettes (these are the book's strength)
- Core argument and evidence
- Contemporary relevance connections
- Vivid scenes and concrete examples
- Intellectual honesty about counterarguments

## Target Cuts by Section

### PREFACE: Cut 30% (from 75 lines to ~50 lines)

**REMOVE:**
- "Six Essential Themes" section (lines 30-50) - redundant with Part Introductions
- Excessive preview of book structure - readers will discover it

**KEEP:**
- Opening anecdote (1797 Bank Restriction)
- Core question and answer
- Brief roadmap

**Expected savings:** ~800 words

---

### PART INTRODUCTIONS: Cut 40% (each from ~25 lines to ~15 lines)

**Current problem:** Part intros repeat what chapters will say

**REVISE to:**
- One paragraph setting up the part's theme
- One paragraph previewing chapters
- Cut detailed chapter summaries

**Expected savings per part:** ~300 words x 4 parts = 1,200 words

---

### CHAPTER 6: Cut 25% (from ~6,500 words to ~4,900 words)

**This is the most overstuffed chapter**

**CUT:**
- Newton biography details not related to monetary decision (lines 10-30): Save 600 words
- Excessive gold point mechanics (lines 60-85): Move to footnotes, save 800 words
- Detailed Bank Rate manipulation examples (lines 110-130): Streamline, save 500 words
- Redundant explanations of gold standard operations: Save 400 words

**KEEP:**
- Opening scene (Newton at furnace)
- Core insight about accidental gold standard
- "Great Forgetting" section (EXPAND this)

**Expected savings:** ~2,300 words

---

### CHAPTER 8: Cut 30% (from ~5,500 words to ~3,850 words)

**Current problem:** Too academic, too detailed

**CUT:**
- Excessive detail on Currency School vs Banking School debates: Save 800 words
- Scottish free banking section (lines 131-150): Cut by 50%, save 400 words
- Colonial hut tax section (lines 151-166): Cut by 50%, save 300 words
- Academic hedging and qualification throughout: Save 300 words

**KEEP:**
- Thomas Attwood character development (EXPAND this)
- Core argument about creditor class interests
- Bank Charter Act narrative
- Evidence that was ignored

**Expected savings:** ~1,800 words

---

### CHAPTER 11: Cut 20% (from ~7,000 words to ~5,600 words)

**Current problem:** Tries to cover too much (1971-2024)

**CUT:**
- Excessive detail on 1970s inflation (lines 119-142): Streamline, save 600 words
- Volcker section (lines 133-142): Cut by 40%, save 400 words
- European Monetary Union section (lines 145-152): Cut by 50%, save 400 words
- Redundant explanations of QE mechanics: Save 300 words

**KEEP:**
- 2008 crisis narrative with Maureen McKenzie
- MMT section (it's accessible and important)
- Productive capacity explanation
- COVID response

**Expected savings:** ~1,700 words

---

### EPILOGUE: Cut 50% or Eliminate (from ~4,000 words to ~2,000 or 0)

**Decision point:** Does the book need an epilogue?

**Option A: Eliminate entirely**
- End with Chapter 11
- Fold key insights into Chapter 11 conclusion
- Savings: 4,000 words

**Option B: Reduce to 2,000 words**
- Keep only forward-looking material
- Cut summary of lessons (already clear from narrative)
- Cut redundant restatements
- Savings: 2,000 words

**RECOMMENDATION: Option A (eliminate)**
- The book's lessons are clear from the narrative
- Epilogue feels redundant
- Ending with Chapter 11 is stronger

**Expected savings:** 4,000 words

---

### GLOBAL CUTS: Throughout manuscript

**Technical sections:** Move excessive detail to footnotes or endnotes
- Gold point calculations
- Reserve ratio mechanics
- Detailed banking statistics
- Academic citations that interrupt flow
**Expected savings:** 2,000 words

**Redundancy:** Eliminate repetition
- Concepts explained multiple times
- Similar examples used in different chapters
- Restating arguments already made
**Expected savings:** 1,500 words

**Academic hedging:** Remove unnecessary qualification
- "It could be argued that..."
- "Some scholars suggest..."
- "While this is debatable..."
**Expected savings:** 800 words

**Transitions:** Tighten between sections
- Long transitional paragraphs
- Excessive signposting
- Redundant summaries
**Expected savings:** 700 words

---

## Total Expected Savings

- Preface: 800 words
- Part Intros: 1,200 words
- Chapter 6: 2,300 words
- Chapter 8: 1,800 words
- Chapter 11: 1,700 words
- Epilogue: 4,000 words
- Global cuts: 5,000 words

**TOTAL: ~17,000 words (17% reduction)**

This brings manuscript from ~100,000 words to ~83,000 words - ideal length for trade publication.

## Implementation Strategy

### PHASE 1: Major Structural Cuts
1. Eliminate or drastically reduce Epilogue
2. Trim Part Introductions
3. Shorten Preface

### PHASE 2: Chapter-Level Cuts
1. Chapter 6 reduction (most overstuffed)
2. Chapter 8 reduction (too academic)
3. Chapter 11 reduction (too much coverage)

### PHASE 3: Global Pass
1. Move technical detail to notes
2. Eliminate redundancy
3. Remove academic hedging
4. Tighten transitions

### PHASE 4: Quality Check
After each cut, verify:
- Argument still clear?
- Evidence still sufficient?
- Narrative still flows?
- Contemporary relevance maintained?

---

## What NOT to Cut

**NEVER cut:**
- Human vignettes (Backwell, Reynolds, McKenzie, etc.)
- Contemporary relevance connections
- Core evidence for main argument
- Intellectual honesty about counterarguments
- Vivid scenes and concrete examples

**These are the book's strengths - cutting them would weaken it**

---

## Quality Checks After Reduction

✓ Is the book now 80,000-85,000 words?
✓ Does it maintain narrative momentum throughout?
✓ Are all core arguments still clear and supported?
✓ Have we cut fat without cutting muscle?
✓ Does the book feel tighter and more focused?
✓ Would readers notice what's missing? (If yes, restore it)

---

## Expected Outcome

A manuscript that:
- Maintains all intellectual substance
- Reads faster and more engagingly
- Holds reader attention throughout
- Meets trade publication length standards
- Costs less to produce
- Appeals to broader audience

Without:
- Losing core arguments
- Sacrificing evidence
- Reducing accessibility
- Weakening human stories
- Compromising contemporary relevance

**After completing length reduction, proceed to Prompt 11 (Term Definition Pass).**
