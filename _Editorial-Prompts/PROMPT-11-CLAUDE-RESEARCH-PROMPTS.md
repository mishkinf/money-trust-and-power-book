WHAT I NEED:

OPTION A: Expand Morvan Lebesque story
Find biographical details:
- Full name, birth/death dates
- Where he worked as journalist (which publications)
- Was HE personally unemployed or just observing?
- His age in 1932-33
- Family situation
- More detailed accounts of his experiences

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE

**For each research prompt:**

1. **Activate web research:** Use your web search and deep research capabilities to find these individuals
2. **Prioritize English sources:** Academic books, journalistic profiles, translated memoirs, documentaries
3. **Verify documentation:** Distinguish primary sources (diaries, interviews) from secondary sources (historians describing cases)
4. **Provide citations:** Full bibliographic information with page numbers or timestamps
5. **Assess quality:** Rate documentation as HIGH (primary source, full name), MEDIUM (secondary source, good detail), or LOW (undocumented/anonymous)
6. **Draft narrative:** Provide a suggested 200-400 word narrative structure integrating the documented details

**If no named individual found:**
- Explicitly state "No documented named individual found meeting criteria"
- Explain what's available: unnamed cases, general descriptions, aggregate data
- Suggest alternative approaches: use aggregate data with transparency, expand research scope, or defer story

**Success criteria:**
- At least 1 of 3 stories should yield a named, well-documented individual
- Preferably 2-3 of 3 stories should be successful
- If unsuccessful, provide clear explanation of documentation gaps and alternative options

---

## BACKUP PLAN IF RESEARCH INCOMPLETE

**If Claude research yields insufficient documentation:**

### Option A: Use what we have
- **French story:** Implement Morvan Lebesque with aggregate data (250 words) - READY NOW
- **German/Japanese:** Defer to future edition, note as research gap

### Option B: Repurpose existing excellent stories
- Use **Harry Todd** (British coal miner) more prominently
- Use **Dean Hagedorn** (Volcker victim) if appropriate chapter exists
- Use **Donald Hartwell** (Dust Bowl) for Depression era

### Option C: Transparent composite approach
- Create representative worker using documented aggregate data
- Explicit methodology note: "This narrative represents typical experience based on documented statistics and contemporaneous accounts. No single named individual with complete documentation was found in accessible sources."

**Decision tree:**
1. Run Claude research → If 2-3 named individuals found → Implement all
2. If 1 individual found → Implement that one + use existing stories elsewhere
3. If 0 individuals found → Use Option A (French only) or Option B (existing stories)

---

## EXPECTED TIMELINE

**Claude Deep Research:** 2-4 hours per prompt = 6-12 hours total  
**Narrative Writing:** 1-2 hours per story = 3-6 hours total  
**Total:** 9-18 hours for complete implementation  

**Deliverable:** 600-900 words of new human stories (3 stories × 200-300 words each) with full citations and documentation quality assessment
