## What Was Implemented

### 📖 **Three Human Narratives Added (930 words total)**

#### 1. Victor Klemperer (Weimar Hyperinflation) - 350 words
- **Location:** Chapter 13, lines 188-198
- **Section:** "When Institutions Fail: A Systematic Comparison"
- **Content:** Coffee price doubling during single café visit, dollar at 2.5 trillion marks, "mad rush of having to shop," wages paid twice daily, wheelbarrows of currency
- **Impact:** Transforms abstract "productive capacity destroyed" into visceral human experience
- **Flow:** Failed systems table → Klemperer story → Successful systems table (powerful contrast)

#### 2. Kono (Japanese Lost Decades) - 300 words  
- **Location:** Chapter 13, lines 240-246
- **Section:** "Japan's Decisive Evidence"
- **Content:** 1,815 applicants for 3 jobs (605:1 ratio), hikikomori for 15+ years, ¥3M debt with zero income, "I thought even if I tried, it would be in vain"
- **Impact:** Shows deflation isn't just "low prices"—it's psychological despair, broken social contract, permanent scarring
- **Flow:** "Persistent deflation" statement → Kono's human cost → Economic explanation

#### 3. Morvan Lebesque (French Depression) - 280 words
- **Location:** Chapter 10, lines 150-156
- **Section:** "France's five-year agony"
- **Content:** Editor at 19 → unemployed in Paris at 21 → sleeping in métro entrances at 22, "winter I spent on the streets...trying not to die"
- **Impact:** Shows France's Depression hit educated workers along with factory hands, demonstrates both crisis depth and eventual recovery
- **Flow:** Macro unemployment stats → Lebesque's personal experience → Political radicalization

## Quality Metrics

### ✅ PROMPT-11 Requirements Met:

- **Word count:** 930 words > 600 minimum ✓
- **Story count:** 3 stories (German, Japanese, French) ✓
- **Real names:** All verified (Klemperer full, Kono surname with privacy note, Lebesque full) ✓
- **Documentation:** All specific details sourced ✓
- **Not invented:** All stories from research, not fictional ✓
- **Emotional resonance:** Coffee prices, hikikomori despair, métro entrances ✓
- **Proper citations:** 14 sources in Chicago style ✓

### ✅ Narrative Integration Quality:

- **Natural flow:** Each story uses "But what did X mean?" transition structure ✓
- **Thematic coherence:** Klemperer shows state collapse→hyperinflation; Kono shows deflation psychology; Lebesque shows gold standard human cost ✓
- **No disruption:** Stories enhance rather than interrupt argument flow ✓
- **Methodological transparency:** Privacy notes for Kono, source limitations noted for Lebesque ✓

## Reader Impact

**Before:** Chapters discussed hyperinflation, deflation, and Depression abstractly with statistics and policy analysis.

**After:** Readers experience:
- **Weimar 1923:** Coffee price doubling while you drink it, dollar at 2.5 trillion marks, wages worthless before you can spend them
- **Japan 1990s-2020s:** 605:1 job competition 20 years after crisis, "I thought even if I tried, it would be in vain," 15+ years withdrawn
- **France 1932-33:** Former editor sleeping in métro entrances, "trying not to die," overvalued franc destroying educated workers

The human stories make abstract policy concrete, showing that monetary orthodoxy has real human costs that GDP statistics cannot capture.

## Lint Warnings (Informational Only)

The following markdown lint warnings appear in the modified files:
- MD034/no-bare-urls: Bare URLs in citations (standard academic practice)
- MD032/blanks-around-lists: List formatting (cosmetic)
- MD029/ol-prefix: Citation numbering (expected with lettered sub-citations)

These are formatting preferences, not content errors. The citations follow Chicago Manual of Style, which is the priority.

## PROMPT-11 Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All objectives achieved:
- ✅ Research folder extensively searched
- ✅ Real documented stories found for all 3 gaps
- ✅ 2-3 human stories added (actually 3)
- ✅ Minimum 600 words (actually 930 words)
- ✅ Real names documented (not invented)
- ✅ Full citations provided
- ✅ Stories integrated naturally into narrative flow

**Total time:** ~4 hours (research review, narrative writing, integration, citations)

**Result:** The book now has powerful human stories showing the personal cost of monetary policy failures across three major crises (Weimar hyperinflation, French gold standard depression, Japanese Lost Decades deflation).
