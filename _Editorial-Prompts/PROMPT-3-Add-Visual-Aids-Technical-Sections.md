# Editorial Prompt: Add Visual Aids for Technical Concepts

## OBSERVATION
**Current Rating: Accessibility 8/10**  
**Target Rating: 9/10**

Three technical concepts risk losing general readers despite strong prose explanations:

1. **Chapter 5: Money creation through double-entry accounting**
2. **Chapter 5: Two-tier banking system (reserves vs. deposits)**
3. **Chapter 8: Currency School vs. Banking School debate**

Text-only explanation of accounting mechanics is inherently challenging. Bestselling nonfiction increasingly uses simple diagrams to anchor complex concepts.

## GOAL
Add 3-4 simple visual aids that transform abstract concepts into immediately graspable images. These should feel like "aha!" moments, not textbook diagrams.

## SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Visual 1: Money Creation Balance Sheet (Chapter 5)
**Purpose:** Show how loan simultaneously creates asset (for bank) and deposit (for borrower)

**Simple two-column format:**
```
BANK BALANCE SHEET - Before Loan
Assets: £0  |  Liabilities: £0

BANK BALANCE SHEET - After £100 Loan to Merchant
Assets: £100 (loan to merchant)  |  Liabilities: £100 (merchant's deposit)

KEY INSIGHT: Both entries created simultaneously by accounting.
No prior deposits needed.
```

### Visual 2: Two-Tier System Diagram (Chapter 5)
**Purpose:** Show relationship between central bank reserves and commercial bank deposits

**Simple pyramid:**
```
                    CENTRAL BANK
                 (creates reserves)
                         |
    ________________________________________________
    |                    |                         |
COMMERCIAL          COMMERCIAL              COMMERCIAL
BANK A              BANK B                  BANK C
(creates deposits)  (creates deposits)      (creates deposits)
```

### Visual 3: Competing Monetary Schools Table (Chapter 8)
Already suggested in Prompt 2—use comparison table instead of extensive prose.

## IMPLEMENTATION

Keep diagrams **extremely simple**:
- Black and white, clean lines
- Minimal text
- No ornate design
- Should work in both print and ebook

**Style reference:** "The Deficit Myth" (Kelton) uses simple text-based diagrams effectively.

## WHAT TO PRESERVE
Don't let visuals replace narrative. They should **supplement**, not substitute. Keep the Thomas Fletcher example and prose explanation—add diagram as reinforcement.
