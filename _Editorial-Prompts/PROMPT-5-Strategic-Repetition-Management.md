# Editorial Prompt: Vary Strategic Repetition for Fresh Impact

## OBSERVATION
**Current Rating: Chapter Organization 8.5/10**  
**Target Rating: 9.5/10**

Core principles repeat across chapters (appropriately for pedagogy), but phrasing is sometimes identical:
- "Taxation creates currency demand" appears ~8 times
- "Money is relationship not thing" appears ~6 times
- "Household budget metaphor" criticism appears ~5 times

This is **thematic repetition** (good) with **identical phrasing** (could improve).

## GOAL
Maintain pedagogical repetition while varying expression. Each return to core principle should feel like deepening understanding, not redundancy.

## HOW TO VARY CORE THEMES

### "Taxation Creates Demand" - Progressive Deepening

**Chapter 1 (introduction):**  
"Mesopotamian farmers accepted temple credits because tax collectors demanded them."

**Chapter 5 (mechanism):**  
"Parliamentary taxation created guaranteed demand for Bank notes—the same principle that sustained Sumerian grain credits now backed paper money."

**Chapter 11 (synthesis):**  
"Tax-driven demand, the pattern linking every successful monetary system from ancient temples to modern central banks, explains why..."

### "Money as Relationship" - Different Angles

**Early chapters:** "Money is recorded obligation, not physical object"  
**Middle chapters:** "Money represents relationships of credit and trust"  
**Late chapters:** "Money manifests institutional authority through social acceptance"

Same idea, fresh expression each time.

## IMPLEMENTATION
Search for repeated phrases. For each occurrence after the first, ask: "How can I express this principle from a new angle while reinforcing the same truth?"

## SUCCESS METRIC
Readers should finish feeling "the author kept showing me new dimensions of the same truth" not "I've read this exact sentence before."
