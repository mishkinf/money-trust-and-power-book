# PROMPT 12B: Consistency Audit (Chapter-by-Chapter)

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours per chapter  
**Applies To:** Each chapter individually  
**Priority:** HIGH - Do after PROMPT 12A (Citation/Fact Verification)

---

## OBJECTIVE

Ensure voice, jargon, terminology, and style are consistent within each chapter and across the entire manuscript. This catches inconsistencies in how concepts are explained, terms are used, and narrative voice is maintained.

---

## PROCESS (Apply to ONE chapter at a time)

### Step 1: Voice Consistency Check

**"You" vs "We" vs Third Person:**
- ✓ Identify narrator voice used in chapter
- ✓ Check for inconsistent switches (e.g., "we" in one paragraph, "you" in another)
- ✓ Verify voice matches book's overall style (likely consistent across all chapters)
- ✓ Flag jarring shifts in perspective

**Example issue:**
> "We see how monetary policy affects..." [paragraph later] "You might wonder why central banks..." 
> → Should pick one voice and stick with it

**Passive vs Active Voice:**
- ✓ Scan for excessive passive constructions
- ✓ Flag passive voice in narrative sections (more acceptable in technical explanations)
- ✓ Prioritize active voice for human stories and dramatic moments

**Example improvement:**
> BEFORE: "The decision was made by Churchill to return to gold."
> AFTER: "Churchill decided to return to gold."

**Sentence Length Variation:**
- ✓ Identify paragraphs with multiple 70+ word sentences
- ✓ Break up overly long sentences for readability
- ✓ Ensure mix of short (10-20 words), medium (20-40 words), and occasional long (40-60 words) sentences
- ✓ Watch for run-on sentences with multiple clauses

**Example issue:**
> 85-word sentence with 4 subordinate clauses → Break into 2-3 shorter sentences

### Step 2: Jargon and Technical Term Consistency

**First-use definitions:**
- ✓ Create list of technical terms used in chapter
- ✓ Verify each term is defined on FIRST use in chapter (or earlier chapter)
- ✓ Check that definition is clear and accessible to general readers

**Key terms to track:**
- Seigniorage
- Output gap
- Beggar-thy-neighbor
- Quantitative easing
- Gold standard
- Fiat money
- Bank reserves
- Monetary base
- M2 money supply
- Sterilization
- Convertibility
- [Add others as encountered]

**Terminology consistency:**
- ✓ Same concept called same thing throughout (don't switch between "QE" and "quantitative easing" randomly)
- ✓ Acronyms defined before use ("Federal Reserve (Fed)" then "Fed" thereafter)
- ✓ Historical terms consistent (e.g., "gold standard" vs "gold-standard" hyphenation)

**Definition check:**
- ✓ If term appears WITHOUT prior definition, flag it
- ✓ If definition is jargon-heavy, simplify it
- ✓ If multiple definitions given (in different chapters), ensure consistency

**Example issue:**
> Chapter 3 defines "monetary base" as X
> Chapter 7 uses "monetary base" differently
> → Needs reconciliation

### Step 3: Style Consistency

**Numbers:**
- ✓ Spell out numbers one through nine, use digits for 10+ (or choose different rule and apply consistently)
- ✓ Commas in large numbers consistent (e.g., 1,000,000 not 1000000)
- ✓ Percentages: "5 percent" or "5%" (pick one style)
- ✓ Dates: "July 4, 1776" or "4 July 1776" (pick one style)
- ✓ Currency: "$100 million" or "$100M" (pick one style)

**Capitalization:**
- ✓ Job titles: "Chancellor of the Exchequer" vs "chancellor" (when not before name)
- ✓ Historical periods: "Great Depression" vs "great depression"
- ✓ Institutions: "Federal Reserve" vs "federal reserve"
- ✓ Economic concepts: "New Deal" vs "new deal"

**Formatting:**
- ✓ Italics for emphasis: used sparingly and consistently
- ✓ Bold: only in headings or key terms (if used)
- ✓ Quotes: double quotes for speech, single quotes for quotes-within-quotes
- ✓ Em-dashes (—) vs en-dashes (–) vs hyphens (-): used correctly

**British vs American spelling:**
- ✓ Choose one dialect (probably American for U.S. publisher)
- ✓ Consistent spelling: labor/labour, recognize/recognise, center/centre
- ✓ Check historical figures: keep British spelling in their quotes

### Step 4: Create/Update Glossary (As you work)

**While auditing, compile glossary entries:**
- ✓ Note every technical term that appears in chapter
- ✓ Extract or write clear 1-2 sentence definition
- ✓ Track page/section where term first appears
- ✓ Goal: 20-30 key terms for back matter glossary

**Glossary format:**
```
**Seigniorage**: The profit a government makes by issuing currency, calculated as the difference between the face value of money and the cost of producing it.

**Output gap**: The difference between an economy's actual output and its potential output at full capacity, indicating whether resources (workers, factories) are underutilized.
```

**Terms to prioritize:**
- Core monetary concepts (readers will look these up)
- Historical terms (might be unfamiliar: "tally sticks," "Stop of Exchequer")
- Technical jargon (anything an undergraduate wouldn't know)

## CHAPTER-BY-CHAPTER WORKFLOW

**Do this for EACH chapter in order:**

1. **Start:** "Beginning consistency audit for Chapter [N]"
2. **Voice:** Check narrator voice consistency
3. **Passive:** Flag excessive passive voice
4. **Sentence length:** Break up 70+ word sentences
5. **Jargon:** Verify all technical terms defined
6. **Style:** Check number, cap, formatting consistency
7. **Glossary:** Add terms to running list
8. **Document:** Create completion report
9. **Move to next chapter**

---

## OUTPUT PER CHAPTER

Create a brief report:

```

**Voice Issues:**
- [List any voice inconsistencies found and fixed]

**Passive Voice:**
- [Number of instances reduced]
- [Examples if significant]

```

---

## CROSS-CHAPTER CONSISTENCY

**After auditing all chapters individually:**

### Final Consistency Pass:
- ✓ Review glossary: merge duplicates, ensure definitions consistent
- ✓ Voice check: narrator voice same across all chapters?
- ✓ Style guide: create 1-page style sheet documenting choices
  - Numbers: How written
  - Dates: Format
  - Capitalization: Rules
  - Quotes: Style
  - Common terms: Preferred spellings

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

For each chapter, verify:
- ✅ Narrator voice consistent within chapter
- ✅ No jarring passive→active switches
- ✅ Sentences vary in length; no 70+ word monsters
- ✅ All technical terms defined before use OR previously defined
- ✅ Number/date/currency formatting consistent
- ✅ Capitalization follows consistent rules
- ✅ British vs American spelling consistent
- ✅ Glossary terms identified and defined

---

## COMMON ISSUES TO WATCH FOR

**Voice problems:**
- Switching from "we argue" to "you can see" to "one might conclude"
- First person in intro, third person in body, second person in conclusion

**Jargon problems:**
- Using "monetary base" without defining, assuming reader knows
- Defining same term differently in different chapters
- Over-explaining basic terms while under-explaining complex ones

**Style problems:**
- "5 percent" in Chapter 1, "5%" in Chapter 3
- "July 4, 1776" in Chapter 2, "4 July 1776" in Chapter 4
- British spelling in American-market book

---

## TOOLS

**Automated checks (if available):**
- Grammarly or ProWritingAid for passive voice detection
- Word count tools for sentence length
- Find/Replace for systematic terminology checks

**Manual checks:**
- Read chapter aloud to catch voice shifts
- Scan for technical terms and verify definitions
- Create checklist for style consistency

---

## DEPENDENCIES

- Should complete PROMPT 12A first (fact-checking)
- Will feed into PROMPT 12C (transitions need consistent voice)
- Glossary created here used in PROMPT 12E (final polish)
