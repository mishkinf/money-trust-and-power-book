# Editorial Prompt: Final Polish to 100% Publication-Ready

## OBSERVATION
After implementing Prompts 9-11, the manuscript will be at 9.0/10. This prompt addresses the final 0.5-1.0 points for 9.5-10/10 rating.

## FINAL POLISH CHECKLIST

Make sure to read every file completely that is within the Content folder hierarchy so we have a complete picture of the story. This will help catch any issues that may have been missed in previous prompts as well as catching any issues with the various dimensions that are used to evaluate a manuscript for publication.

### 1. Consistency Audit (3 hours)
**Voice consistency:**
- ✓ Check "you" vs "we" usage (pick one, use consistently)
- ✓ Passive voice audit (minimize in narrative sections)
- ✓ Sentence length variation (break 70+ word sentences)

**Jargon consistency:**
- ✓ Verify technical terms defined on first use
- ✓ Create 20-30 term glossary for back matter (terms and definitions are in the _Supplementary folder)
- ✓ Check "seigniorage," "output gap," "beggar thy neighbor" defined before use

**Citation consistency:**
- ✓ Chicago Manual 17th edition throughout
- ✓ Verify all [VERIFY] flags resolved or removed
- ✓ Check footnote numbering sequence

### 2. Transition Smoothing (2 hours)
**Chapter transitions:**
- ✓ Read last paragraph Ch N → first paragraph Ch N+1 for all chapters
- ✓ Ensure each chapter ending creates momentum for next
- ✓ Part transitions (I→II, II→III, III→IV) have thematic bridges

**Section transitions:**
- ✓ Within-chapter flow between major sections
- ✓ Contemporary opening → historical narrative feels natural
- ✓ "Why This Matters Now" integrations don't feel tacked on

### 3. Pacing Verification (2 hours)
**Read-aloud test:**
- ✓ Read ALL chapters completely aloud to catch awkward phrasing
- ✓ Identify sections where attention wanders
- ✓ Verify no chapter feels significantly slower than others

**Chapter length audit:**
- ✓ Final check: All chapters 5,500-7,500 words (except Preface/Epilogue)
- ✓ Part III (chapters 6-9) doesn't feel longer than dramatic content warrants

### 4. Contemporary Relevance Check (1 hour)
**Verify all contemporary openings:**
- ✓ Bitcoin (Ch 1), Greece (Ch 3), 2008 (Ch 4, 13), etc. all still relevant
- ✓ No outdated references (check crypto examples, COVID timeline)
- ✓ "Why This Matters Now" sections feel urgent, not forced

### 5. Emotional Arc Verification (1 hour)
**Human stories present:**
- ✓ Part I: Amat-Sîn, Datini
- ✓ Part II: Backwell
- ✓ Part III: Woodforde, Attwood, farmers
- ✓ Part IV: Harry Todd, Maureen McKenzie, + any new additions from Prompt 11
- ✓ Epilogue: Returns to human dimension

**Suffering → understanding → hope arc:**
- ✓ Book shows monetary policy's human cost
- ✓ Explains why suffering occurred (not random)
- ✓ Ends with institutional solutions (not despair)

### 6. Fact-Check Final Pass (4 hours)
**Verify all quantitative claims:**
- ✓ Dates (conference dates, crisis dates, gold standard chronology)
- ✓ Numbers (gold holdings %, debt amounts, QE quantities)
- ✓ Names and titles (correct spellings, accurate positions)
- ✓ Quotes (exact wording from sources)

**Citation completeness:**
- ✓ Every factual claim has footnote or is common knowledge
- ✓ All points should source its data from content in @Research folder and should use root source citations in the chapter (dont cite our internal research files themselves)
- ✓ Bibliography complete and properly formatted
- For anything that seems like it may be made up or hallucination because we cannot determine the source, we should flag it with a [VERIFY] tag.

### 7. Professional Copyedit Checklist (2 hours)
**Spelling/Grammar:**
- ✓ Run spell-check (British vs American spelling consistent?)
- ✓ Check common errors (it's/its, affect/effect, that/which)
- ✓ Verify em-dash, en-dash, hyphen usage

**Formatting:**
- ✓ Consistent heading hierarchy (## Part, ### Chapter, #### Section)
- ✓ Blockquote formatting consistent
- ✓ Footnote formatting consistent
- ✓ Table/figure captions if any visuals added
