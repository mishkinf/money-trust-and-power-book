## INTEGRATION NOTES

### Voice and Tone Requirements

All research findings must be presented in a way that allows integration with the book's existing voice:

**Narrative Style:**
- Dramatic but precise
- Uses specific numbers and dates
- Balances human stories with analytical insight
- Contemporary parallels feel natural, not forced

**Sentence Rhythm:**
- Short declarative for emphasis (1-10 words)
- Medium explanatory for clarity (15-25 words)
- Longer analytical for complexity (30-45 words)
- Varied rhythm, not monotonous

**Analytical Approach:**
- Always asks "who benefits?"
- Connects institutional mechanisms to distributional outcomes
- Respects marginalized voices (Attwood, Chartists)
- Critical but not polemical

### Example of Desired Integration

**Raw Research Finding:**
"The Bardi family lent Edward III £900,000 between 1338-1345."

**Integrated into Book's Voice:**
> The Bardi had lent Edward £900,000—roughly twice the annual revenue of the English crown. When Edward defaulted in 1345, the shock rippled through Florence. The Bardi, who had financed popes and emperors for generations, collapsed within months. The Peruzzi followed. Florentine banking, which had dominated European finance for a century, never fully recovered.
