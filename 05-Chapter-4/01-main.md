# The Glorious Revolution and the Birth of the Bank of England

A cold rain fell on London as William of Orange rode through the city gates in December 1688. He had crossed the Channel with an army, but he would take the throne without a battle. King James II, abandoned by his own officers and nobles, had fled to France. What followed was not merely a change of monarchs but a **constitutional revolution**—a permanent transfer of power from crown to Parliament that would reshape not just England's government but its entire financial system.¹

The settlement was explicit: William and Mary would rule, but only if they accepted Parliament's supremacy. The Bill of Rights (1689) declared that the monarch could not suspend laws, levy taxes, or maintain a standing army without parliamentary consent. For the first time in English history, the power to spend and the power to tax were **legally inseparable**. A king could no longer borrow on his personal credit and leave Parliament to clean up the mess. Every loan, every expenditure, every military campaign would require legislative approval.²

This was not a theoretical nicety. It was a **financial revolution** disguised as a political one. By tying the crown's hands, Parliament made England's debt credible. Lenders no longer had to trust a king's word; they could trust a nation's law.

### The goldsmith catastrophe: How private money failed

To understand what the Bank of England would become, one must first grasp what existed before it—and why it failed catastrophically. The story begins not with the Glorious Revolution but with a desperate wartime improvisation that would accidentally create England's first private paper money, only to see it collapse in spectacular ruin.

In 1640, **Charles I seized £200,000 from the Royal Mint** to finance his escalating conflicts with Parliament and Scotland. The King's agents simply walked into the Mint, took the money, and left merchants and nobles with worthless receipts. The act destroyed confidence in government storage overnight. Wealthy Londoners who had trusted the crown with their bullion now faced a choice: where could they safely store their wealth?³

The answer came from an unlikely source: the goldsmiths of Lombard Street. These were artisans who worked precious metals—craftsmen like **Lawrence Hoare** and **Edward Backwell**—whose workshops had strong vaults for securing their inventory. After 1640, they began accepting deposits of gold and silver, issuing receipts as proof of storage. Initially these were simple warehouse receipts: "Received from John Smith ten pounds sterling in gold coin, to be returned upon presentation of this receipt."³ᵃ

But during the English Civil War (1642-1651), a revolutionary change occurred. Goldsmiths began issuing receipts **"payable to bearer"** rather than to a named individual. This subtle shift transformed the receipts from personal IOUs into something that could circulate throughout London. A merchant receiving a goldsmith receipt in payment didn't need to visit the goldsmith to redeem it—he could simply pass it to the next person. London had accidentally invented **the first true private paper money in English history**.³ᵇ

By the 1660s, goldsmith banking had become the dominant force in London finance. **Edward Backwell**, originally a goldsmith on Fleet Street, had transformed his business into something resembling a modern bank. His depositors included Charles II himself, the future James II, Samuel Pepys (the diarist), and the East India Company. Other major goldsmith-bankers—Robert Vyner, Alderman John Coggs, Gilbert Whitehall—competed for the business of England's elite. Their receipts circulated not just in London but throughout southern England, functioning as de facto currency for large transactions.⁴

More revolutionary still, the goldsmith-bankers discovered **fractional reserve banking**. They realized that not all depositors would demand their gold simultaneously. If £1,000 sat in the vault and only £100 was typically withdrawn in a given week, why not lend £500 to a merchant at interest? The goldsmith would create a new receipt—"payable to bearer on demand"—and give it to the borrower, who would spend it into circulation. The goldsmith had just **created money "out of thin air"** through double-entry bookkeeping: the loan was an asset, the receipt a liability. As financial historian Alexander Faure writes, "money creation as we know it today...began when the deposit receipts of goldsmith-bankers became accepted by the general public...they could make loans by writing out new receipts (i.e. money)."⁴ᵃ

Reserve ratios varied wildly—French banker Richard Cantillon, writing in the 1730s, documented ranges from 10 percent to 66 percent across different goldsmith-bankers. There were no regulations, no statutory requirements, no government oversight. The system operated entirely on reputation and market discipline. If a goldsmith-banker over-extended and couldn't honor redemptions, his receipts would trade at a discount or his business would fail. But during good times, the profits were enormous: lending at 6-8 percent interest while paying nothing on deposits (the receipts themselves bore no interest).⁴ᵇ

**Was this authorized?** No. Goldsmith banking emerged in a **legal gray area**—no charters, no parliamentary authorization, purely emergent based on commercial practice and market acceptance. This contrasts sharply with chartered institutions like Sweden's Riksbank (1668) or Amsterdam's Wisselbank (1609), which operated under explicit government mandate. English goldsmith receipts represent perhaps the only clear historical case of large-scale private money creation without initial state sanction. The system worked because London's merchant community trusted it to work. But that trust rested on a foundation of sand.⁴ᶜ

On the morning of **January 2, 1672**, that foundation crumbled. Charles II, desperate for funds to wage the Third Anglo-Dutch War, issued an order suspending repayment of **£1.3 million** owed to the goldsmith-bankers. The **Stop of the Exchequer**, as it became known, was in effect a sovereign default—the King simply stopped paying his debts. The impact was immediate and devastating.

Five major goldsmith banks—including Edward Backwell's firm—went bankrupt within weeks. Nine others were severely undermined, teetering on the edge of failure. Over **10,000 wealthy families** who had deposited money with the goldsmiths or held their receipts were financially ruined. Bishop Gilbert Burnet recorded that "the bankers were broken, and multitudes who had put their money in their hands were ruined by this dishonourable and perfidious action." Commerce in London "ground to a halt" as credit dried up and cash became scarce.⁵

What followed were decades of legal chaos. Creditors sued the crown, each other, and the goldsmith estates. Legal battles dragged on until 1700—**twenty-eight years**—with only about half of creditors eventually receiving some payment. The goldsmith-bankers who had held the King's tallies (essentially government IOUs) found those tallies worth a fraction of face value. Secondary markets developed where desperate creditors sold their claims at 40-60 percent discounts. Moshe Milevsky's historical analysis shows that the eventual recovery rate was approximately 50 percent—but paid out over decades, meaning the real value was far less after accounting for time and inflation.⁵ᵃ

The Stop proved two things. First, goldsmith receipts had become **true money**—otherwise the default wouldn't have caused such catastrophic systemic disruption. If the receipts had been mere warehouse tokens, the King's failure to repay loans to a few dozen bankers wouldn't have paralyzed London commerce. But because goldsmith receipts circulated widely as currency, their collapse destroyed the payment system itself.

Second, and more importantly, the Stop demonstrated the **fatal flaw of unregulated private money**: **no crisis resolution mechanism**. When the system failed, there was no lender of last resort, no deposit insurance, no government backstop. The goldsmiths who were solvent tried to maintain operations, but public panic was indiscriminate—even sound banks faced redemption runs. Those who moved first got their gold back; those who moved slowly got nothing. The market discipline that supposedly kept goldsmith-bankers honest proved brutal and indiscriminate in crisis, punishing depositors rather than the reckless sovereign who had triggered the collapse.⁵ᵇ

The solution, when it finally came in 1694, was **state intervention**. The Bank of England was chartered explicitly to solve the problems the goldsmith catastrophe had revealed: create a stable institutional framework, provide government finance on sound terms, issue uniform currency backed by parliamentary taxation, and offer crisis liquidity when private credit froze. The Bank wasn't a market innovation that spontaneously emerged—it was a regulatory response to market failure. By 1704, Parliament retrospectively legalized private banking practices through the Promissory Notes Act, establishing rules around negotiable instruments that had operated in legal limbo for six decades.⁵ᶜ

The era of truly unauthorized private money had ended. What replaced it was a system where private banks could create money—but only within a framework the state provided, regulated, and ultimately guaranteed. The lesson was clear, though it would be forgotten and rediscovered repeatedly over the next three centuries: **private money without state foundation ends in catastrophe**. Stable money creation requires institutional credibility that only the state can provide through its power to tax, its capacity to enforce law, and its willingness to backstop the system when crisis comes.

Across the Channel and the North Sea, other nations had already learned this lesson. Sweden's **Riksbank** (1668) operated as a government institution from inception. Amsterdam's Wisselbank (1609) was founded by the city council, not private merchants. But England in 1688 still had nothing comparable. Its monetary system remained fragmented, its government credit worthless after decades of royal defaults, and its capacity to finance war crippled by the goldsmith banking collapse. The Glorious Revolution would finally change this—not through military conquest but through **institutional innovation** built on the wreckage of private money's failure.

### The cost of legitimacy

William's throne came with an immediate price: war. Louis XIV of France, Europe's most powerful monarch, refused to recognize the new regime. He sheltered James II in exile and threatened to restore him by force. England, allied with the Dutch Republic and the Holy Roman Empire, was drawn into the **Nine Years' War** (1688–1697)—a conflict that would test whether parliamentary government could survive the fiscal demands of modern warfare.³

The numbers were staggering. William needed **£5.5 million annually** at first, rising to **£8.5 million by war's end**—sums that dwarfed any previous English military expenditure. England's traditional revenues—customs duties, excise taxes, and crown lands—brought in barely half that amount. The gap had to be filled by borrowing, and borrowing required something England had never possessed: **institutional credibility**.⁴

The memory of the Stop of the Exchequer still haunted London's financial community. In 1672, Charles II had suspended debt payments, ruining the goldsmith-bankers who had lent to him. No merchant would make that mistake again. If the new government wanted credit, it would have to offer more than royal promises. It would have to create a **mechanism** that guaranteed repayment even if the king changed his mind.⁵

---

### The bargain

Parliament's solution was elegant and unprecedented. Every loan to the government would be backed by **specific taxes**, legally earmarked for debt service. Creditors were no longer betting on the king's honesty; they were betting on Parliament's ability to collect revenue. And because Parliament represented the propertied classes—the very people who paid most taxes—it had every incentive to honor its commitments. Default would mean taxing themselves to pay for someone else's losses.⁶

This principle gave rise to what historians call the **fiscal-military state**: a government capable of borrowing vast sums at relatively low interest because its debts were secured by law, not personality. Between 1688 and 1697, England's national debt grew from nearly nothing to over **£16 million**. Yet interest rates fell, because lenders trusted the new system. France, by contrast, borrowed more but paid higher rates, because French kings could still repudiate debts at will.⁷

The difference was not economic but **constitutional**. England had solved the paradox that had trapped every early modern monarchy: how to borrow without surrendering sovereignty. The answer was to surrender sovereignty—but to Parliament, not to creditors. The king remained head of state, but he no longer controlled the purse. That power now belonged to the institution that represented the nation's wealth.

---

### The invention of the Bank

Yet even with parliamentary backing, England's war finance remained chaotic. Loans were negotiated piecemeal, with different creditors holding different instruments at different rates. The government had no central institution to manage its debt, coordinate borrowing, or ensure liquidity. What it needed was a **bank**—not a private goldsmith's shop but a public corporation chartered to serve the state.⁸

The idea came from a group of London merchants and financiers, led by William Paterson and Michael Godfrey. Their proposal, presented to Parliament in 1694, was audacious: create a joint-stock company that would lend **£1.2 million** to the government at **8 percent interest**. In return, the company would receive a royal charter and the exclusive right to issue **banknotes**—paper receipts representing its own liabilities, which could circulate as money.⁹

The scale was unprecedented. The £1.2 million loan represented approximately **2.0-2.4% of English GDP** and equaled **100% of annual government revenue**—proportionally far larger than any modern central bank founding.⁹ᵃ In today's terms, this would be equivalent to roughly **$635 million to $1 billion** in purchasing power, or asking a modern government to borrow its entire annual revenue in a single transaction. The loan could have paid 60,000 skilled craftsmen for a year, purchased 146 small warships, or maintained 40,000-60,000 soldiers for a full campaign.⁹ᵇ

The response was astonishing. The entire sum was subscribed in just **eleven days** by over **1,200 individuals**—from nobles and merchants to shopkeepers and widows. Yet the mechanics were more complex than they appeared. Investors did not pay the full £1.2 million immediately. Through phased capital calls, only **25 percent** was due at subscription, with another **35 percent** later in 1694. The actual cash paid in—**£720,000**—was recorded under the "Banknote" heading on the balance sheet, a novel accounting treatment that reflected the Bank's dual nature as both lender and note-issuer.¹⁰

The mechanics were revolutionary. Investors subscribed capital—paying in coin, bullion, or government tallies—and that capital was lent to the state. But the Bank would not simply hand over gold and wait for repayment. Instead, it would issue **notes**: printed promises to pay the bearer on demand. Those notes, backed by the Bank's assets (including the government loan), would enter circulation as a new form of currency.

On the Bank's ledger, the transaction looked like this:

**Assets**: Loan to Government £1.2 million  
**Liabilities**: Banknotes Issued £1.2 million

The loan was the asset; the notes were the liability. When the government spent those notes—paying soldiers, buying supplies, or funding allies—they became **money**, circulating through the economy as purchasing power. The Bank had, in effect, **created money by lending**.¹¹

To manage this revolutionary system, the Bank developed unprecedented institutional capacity. By the 1780s, approximately **300 clerks** maintained detailed asset-liability ledgers—**five times more** than the Treasury employed. This bureaucratic machinery, recording every transaction in double-entry format, was what made the Bank's promises credible. The ledgers were the foundation; the notes were merely their portable expression.¹²

---

### The mechanics of permanence

What made this system work was not the gold in the Bank's vaults but the **permanence** of the debt. The £1.2 million loan was not a short-term advance to be repaid when taxes came in. It was a **perpetual obligation**: the government would pay 8 percent interest every year, but it would never repay the principal unless it chose to. The Bank's shareholders were not creditors waiting for their money back; they were **rentiers**, earning a steady income from the state's promise to pay.¹³

This structure had profound implications. Because the debt was permanent, the Bank did not need to hold enough gold to redeem all its notes at once. It only needed to maintain confidence that notes were **convertible**—that anyone who wanted coin could get it. As long as most people preferred the convenience of paper, the Bank could issue far more notes than it held in specie. The difference was **credit**, created by double-entry bookkeeping and backed by the government's taxing power.¹⁴

Within three years, the funding model had evolved even further. By 1697, the Bank's balance sheet showed that **banknotes and bills outstanding made up the lion's share of its funding sources**—not shareholder capital. The Bank was issuing **non-interest-bearing notes** (essentially free money) to fund **interest-bearing government debt**, capturing the spread as profit. This was the birth of modern central banking: the alchemy of turning paper into gold by making promises credible.¹⁵

---

### The quid pro quo

The Bank's charter was not a gift; it was a **bargain**. In exchange for lending to the government on favorable terms, the Bank received privileges that made it the most powerful financial institution in England. Each charter renewal involved an explicit trade:

- **1697**: The Bank increased its capital by £1 million and received a monopoly clause prohibiting other banks by Act of Parliament.
- **1708**: The Bank made a £400,000 interest-free loan and gained a prohibition on partnerships of more than six persons from issuing notes—creating a de facto monopoly on joint-stock banking.
- **1742**: A £1.6 million interest-free loan reduced the interest rate on the total debt to 3 percent.
- **1800**: A £3 million interest-free loan for six years further extended the Bank's privileges.¹⁶

The pattern was consistent: the government granted monopoly power, and the Bank provided cheap credit. Neither side could afford to break the relationship. The Bank depended on its charter for legal authority; the government depended on the Bank for liquidity. The partnership was **symbiotic**, and it would endure for more than two centuries.¹⁷

Critically, the loans were **never closed out**. As a Bank of England Freedom of Information response confirmed in 2020: "When the Bank was founded in 1694 it lent £1.2 million to the government. Over the next 140 years the debt increased and decreased until in 1834 the amount outstanding was £11,015,100... When the Bank was nationalised in 1946 the outstanding balance was still £11,015,100."¹⁸ The debt rolled over indefinitely, with interest rates renegotiated but principal never repaid. This was not a bug but a feature: the permanence of the debt was what made the Bank's notes valuable.

---

### Why foreigners accepted it

The genius of the system was that it worked **both domestically and internationally**. At home, the Bank's notes circulated because they were redeemable in coin and accepted for taxes. Anyone who owed the Exchequer could pay in Bank notes, creating a baseline demand. The government's spending injected notes into the economy; taxation withdrew them. The cycle ensured that notes retained value, because everyone eventually needed them to satisfy obligations to the state.¹⁹

But why would **foreign creditors** accept this arrangement? Why would a Dutch merchant or a German banker lend to England when the debt was denominated in paper promises?

The answer lay in **parliamentary taxation**. Foreign lenders did not care about the Bank's notes per se; they cared about England's ability to **convert** those notes into gold or goods when needed. And that ability depended on the government's power to tax. Because Parliament legally controlled taxation, and because Parliament represented the wealthiest subjects, creditors could trust that England would always have the revenue to meet its obligations.²⁰

In other words:
- **Domestically**, taxation made the Bank's notes valuable by creating demand for them.
- **Internationally**, taxation made England's promises credible by demonstrating the state's capacity to pay.

This dual function—internal legitimacy and external solvency—was what made Britain's experiment succeed where France's absolutism failed. French kings borrowed more but defaulted often, because they lacked a representative body to secure revenues. England, after 1688, created the opposite model: **limited monarchy, unlimited credit**.²¹

---

### The triangle of trust

The Bank of England completed a self-reinforcing system that would define modern finance:

1. **The Bank created money** by lending to the state, issuing notes that circulated as currency.
2. **The state spent that money** into the economy, paying soldiers, suppliers, and allies.
3. **Taxation, authorized by Parliament**, withdrew money from circulation, controlled inflation, and guaranteed demand for the currency.

Each element depended on the others. The Bank's notes had value because the state accepted them for taxes. The state could borrow because the Bank provided liquidity. And Parliament could tax because it controlled both the state and the Bank through legal charter. The triangle was **closed**: no single actor could break it without destroying the system.²²

From a modern perspective, this was a profound institutionalization of the principle that **money is credit, and credit is trust**. The government did not need to hoard gold to create money; it needed only to make credible promises. Those promises were backed not by metal but by **law**—the legal power to tax, the legal obligation to pay, and the legal framework that bound them together.

---

### The French counterfactual

France's failure to replicate England's success reveals why institutions mattered more than resources. France was larger, wealthier, and more populous than England—yet it paid consistently higher interest rates and suffered repeated debt crises. During 1700-1750, England's government bonds yielded 3-5 percent while France paid 7-11 percent—roughly 60 percent more in annual interest for the same amount borrowed.²²ᵃ

The root cause was **serial default**. France restructured or repudiated debts in 1634, 1648, 1652, and 1716, destroying creditor confidence each time. By 1659, the monarchy paid over 25 percent on new loans.²²ᵇ England's only comparable default—the 1672 Stop of the Exchequer—was followed by the 1688 constitutional revolution that made future defaults impossible. Post-1690, Britain never repudiated its perpetual debt.

France's tax system compounded the problem. The crown outsourced collection to *fermiers généraux* (tax farmers) who kept 30-40 percent of gross receipts as profit. Only 60-70 percent of nominal taxes reached the treasury.²²ᶜ England's parliamentary system collected taxes through salaried officials at 3-5 percent cost, with nearly all revenue reaching the Treasury. Despite France's larger economy, Britain extracted more revenue per capita because Parliament authorized levies and credibly committed them to debt service.

Why couldn't France create its own Bank of England? The institutional prerequisites were absent. England's system depended on Parliament's credible commitment—a stable coalition that protected creditors. France had no equivalent. The king rarely convened the Estates-General, and no power-sharing arrangement bound the monarchy to creditors. John Law's Banque Générale (1716) attempted to replicate the Bank of England's model, but without parliamentary backing it collapsed spectacularly in 1720. The Mississippi Bubble's burst discredited central banking in France for decades.²²ᵈ

Only Napoleon's reforms provided the institutional foundation France had lacked. The Revolution abolished feudal privileges, unifying the tax base. Napoleon's strong central state imposed uniform taxes and stabilized debt. In 1800, he chartered the Banque de France with state backing, finally giving France what England had enjoyed since 1690.²²ᵉ

The comparison reveals a fundamental truth: **financial revolutions require political revolutions**. England's advantage was constitutional, not economic. Parliamentary control of taxation made debt credible, enabling cheap borrowing that financed wars and built empire. The Bank of England was the **consequence** of institutional change, not its cause—a mechanism that worked only because the underlying political settlement made promises enforceable.

---

### The evolution toward central banking

The Bank of England was not initially conceived as a "central bank" in the modern sense. It was a private joint-stock company that happened to serve the government. But over the next century, it would evolve functions that would define central banking for the world:

**Monopoly on note issuance**: Through successive charter renewals, the Bank gained exclusive rights to issue banknotes in England, creating a **uniform currency** that replaced the chaotic patchwork of private goldsmith notes. By the mid-18th century, "Bank of England note" and "money" had become nearly synonymous.²³

**Lender of last resort**: During financial panics, the Bank learned to provide emergency liquidity to solvent but illiquid banks, preventing cascading failures. This function—articulated theoretically by Henry Thornton in 1802 and Walter Bagehot in 1873—became the defining characteristic of central banking. The Bank held reserves not just for its own needs but as a **backstop for the entire system**.²⁴

**Manager of government debt**: The Bank became the government's fiscal agent, managing bond issuances, servicing debt payments, and coordinating with the Treasury. This relationship, formalized through repeated charter renewals, made the Bank indispensable to state finance.²⁵

These functions emerged gradually, through crisis and experimentation. But they established a template that other nations would follow. When Napoleon created the **Banque de France** in 1800 to stabilize currency after revolutionary hyperinflation, he explicitly modeled it on the Bank of England—a state-chartered institution with monopoly note-issuance and the mission of financing government. When the United States finally established the Federal Reserve in 1913, after decades of chaotic free banking, it too drew on the English precedent.²⁶

The Bank of England had invented a new institutional form: the **central bank** as a hybrid public-private entity, serving both commercial and sovereign functions, creating money through credit while maintaining convertibility through reserves. It was not the first bank to serve a government—Sweden's Riksbank predated it by 26 years. But it was the first to demonstrate that such an institution could survive war, crisis, and political upheaval while maintaining credibility. That lesson would reshape the world's monetary architecture.

---

### The legacy of 1694

The Bank of England's founding marked a turning point in monetary history. For the first time, a government had created an institution that could **manufacture credit on demand**, limited only by the need to maintain confidence. The Bank did not discover some hidden reserve of wealth; it **invented** wealth by making promises believable.

This was not alchemy in the mystical sense but in the practical one: the transformation of base materials (paper, ink, and ledgers) into something that functioned as gold. The trick was not in the paper but in the **institutions** that gave it meaning—Parliament's taxing power, the Bank's monopoly charter, and the legal framework that bound them.

Other nations would try to copy the model. Some, like the Netherlands, succeeded. Others, like France, failed because they lacked the constitutional foundations. The difference was always the same: **trust required institutions, and institutions required limits on arbitrary power**. A king who could dissolve Parliament or repudiate debts could never borrow as cheaply as a government that had surrendered those prerogatives.

The Bank of England proved that the future belonged not to the richest states but to the most **credible** ones. And credibility, it turned out, was not a matter of gold reserves but of legal architecture. The real revolution of 1688 was not political but financial: the discovery that **money is a relationship**, and relationships endure only when they are governed by rules no single party can break.

But how, exactly, did this system work in practice? How did the Bank create money by lending? Why did taxation make those notes valuable domestically while parliamentary credibility satisfied foreign lenders? The mechanics of this revolutionary system—the alchemy that turned promises into purchasing power—would define modern finance and reveal truths about money that had been obscured for millennia.

---

### **Chapter Summary**

The Glorious Revolution of 1688 created the institutional foundation for modern central banking by transferring fiscal power from crown to Parliament. Parliamentary control of taxation made England's debt credible for the first time—lenders could trust a nation's legal obligation even if they distrusted the monarch. The Bank of England (1694) completed this revolution by creating a mechanism to manufacture credit on demand: lending £1.2 million to government (2% of GDP) by issuing banknotes backed by parliamentary guarantees. The Bank's notes circulated domestically because taxes created demand; foreign creditors accepted them because parliamentary taxation demonstrated fiscal capacity. France's failure to replicate this success—paying 7-11% interest versus England's 3-5%—proved that institutions mattered more than resources. French serial defaults, tax farming inefficiency (30-40% leakage), and lack of constitutional checks made borrowing ruinously expensive until Napoleon's reforms enabled the Banque de France in 1800. The real revolution was discovering that money is a relationship governed by law, not a commodity backed by metal.
