# The Glorious Revolution and the Birth of the Bank of England

A cold rain fell on London as William of Orange rode through the city gates in December 1688. He had crossed the Channel with an army, but he would take the throne without a battle. King James II, abandoned by his own officers and nobles, had fled to France. What followed was not merely a change of monarchs but a **constitutional revolution**—a permanent transfer of power from crown to Parliament that would reshape not just England's government but its entire financial system.¹

The settlement was explicit: William and Mary would rule, but only if they accepted Parliament's supremacy. The Bill of Rights (1689) declared that the monarch could not suspend laws, levy taxes, or maintain a standing army without parliamentary consent. For the first time in English history, the power to spend and the power to tax were **legally inseparable**. A king could no longer borrow on his personal credit and leave Parliament to clean up the mess. Every loan, every expenditure, every military campaign would require legislative approval.²

This was not a theoretical nicety. It was a **financial revolution** disguised as a political one. By tying the crown's hands, Parliament made England's debt credible. Lenders no longer had to trust a king's word; they could trust a nation's law.

### The world before central banks

To understand what the Bank of England would become, one must first grasp what existed before it. In the 1680s, England's monetary system was a patchwork of private arrangements. Wealthy **goldsmith-bankers**—men like Edward Backwell and Robert Vyner—held gold and silver in their vaults and issued receipts to depositors. These receipts, promising to pay the bearer on demand, circulated as a primitive form of paper money when the goldsmith's reputation was sound.³

The system worked tolerably well for ordinary commerce. But it had fatal weaknesses. Each goldsmith issued his own notes, accepted only by those who trusted that particular firm. There was no unified currency, no lender of last resort, no institution to stabilize the system during panics. When Charles II suspended debt payments in 1672—the infamous **Stop of the Exchequer**—several major goldsmith-bankers failed, taking their depositors' wealth with them. The episode demonstrated that private credit, however sophisticated, could not bear the weight of sovereign finance.⁴

Across the Channel and the North Sea, other nations were experimenting with more centralized solutions. Sweden had established the **Riksbank** in 1668—arguably the world's first central bank—to manage government finances and issue a uniform currency. Amsterdam's Bank of 1609 had pioneered the concept of a public bank holding deposits and facilitating payments, though it did not issue notes or lend to the government. These institutions showed that banking need not be purely private, that a sovereign-backed bank could provide stability that merchant houses could not.⁵

But England in 1688 had nothing comparable. Its monetary system remained fragmented, its government credit was worthless after decades of royal defaults, and its capacity to finance war was crippled. The Glorious Revolution would change all that—not through military conquest but through **institutional innovation**.

### The cost of legitimacy

William's throne came with an immediate price: war. Louis XIV of France, Europe's most powerful monarch, refused to recognize the new regime. He sheltered James II in exile and threatened to restore him by force. England, allied with the Dutch Republic and the Holy Roman Empire, was drawn into the **Nine Years' War** (1688–1697)—a conflict that would test whether parliamentary government could survive the fiscal demands of modern warfare.³

The numbers were staggering. William needed **£5.5 million annually** at first, rising to **£8.5 million by war's end**—sums that dwarfed any previous English military expenditure. England's traditional revenues—customs duties, excise taxes, and crown lands—brought in barely half that amount. The gap had to be filled by borrowing, and borrowing required something England had never possessed: **institutional credibility**.⁴

The memory of the Stop of the Exchequer still haunted London's financial community. In 1672, Charles II had suspended debt payments, ruining the goldsmith-bankers who had lent to him. No merchant would make that mistake again. If the new government wanted credit, it would have to offer more than royal promises. It would have to create a **mechanism** that guaranteed repayment even if the king changed his mind.⁵

### The bargain

Parliament's solution was elegant and unprecedented. Every loan to the government would be backed by **specific taxes**, legally earmarked for debt service. Creditors were no longer betting on the king's honesty; they were betting on Parliament's ability to collect revenue. And because Parliament represented the propertied classes—the very people who paid most taxes—it had every incentive to honor its commitments. Default would mean taxing themselves to pay for someone else's losses.⁶

This principle gave rise to what historians call the **fiscal-military state**: a government capable of borrowing vast sums at relatively low interest because its debts were secured by law, not personality. Between 1688 and 1697, England's national debt grew from nearly nothing to over **£16 million**. Yet interest rates fell, because lenders trusted the new system. France, by contrast, borrowed more but paid higher rates, because French kings could still repudiate debts at will.⁷

The difference was not economic but **constitutional**. England had solved the paradox that had trapped every early modern monarchy: how to borrow without surrendering sovereignty. The answer was to surrender sovereignty—but to Parliament, not to creditors. The king remained head of state, but he no longer controlled the purse. That power now belonged to the institution that represented the nation's wealth.

### The invention of the Bank

Yet even with parliamentary backing, England's war finance remained chaotic. Loans were negotiated piecemeal, with different creditors holding different instruments at different rates. The government had no central institution to manage its debt, coordinate borrowing, or ensure liquidity. What it needed was a **bank**—not a private goldsmith's shop but a public corporation chartered to serve the state.⁸

The idea came from a group of London merchants and financiers, led by William Paterson and Michael Godfrey. Their proposal, presented to Parliament in 1694, was audacious: create a joint-stock company that would lend **£1.2 million** to the government at **8 percent interest**. In return, the company would receive a royal charter and the exclusive right to issue **banknotes**—paper receipts representing its own liabilities, which could circulate as money.⁹

The response was astonishing. The entire sum was subscribed in just **eleven days** by over **1,200 individuals**—from nobles and merchants to shopkeepers and widows. Yet the mechanics were more complex than they appeared. Investors did not pay the full £1.2 million immediately. Through phased capital calls, only **25 percent** was due at subscription, with another **35 percent** later in 1694. The actual cash paid in—**£720,000**—was recorded under the "Banknote" heading on the balance sheet, a novel accounting treatment that reflected the Bank's dual nature as both lender and note-issuer.¹⁰

The mechanics were revolutionary. Investors subscribed capital—paying in coin, bullion, or government tallies—and that capital was lent to the state. But the Bank would not simply hand over gold and wait for repayment. Instead, it would issue **notes**: printed promises to pay the bearer on demand. Those notes, backed by the Bank's assets (including the government loan), would enter circulation as a new form of currency.

On the Bank's ledger, the transaction looked like this:

**Assets**: Loan to Government £1.2 million  
**Liabilities**: Banknotes Issued £1.2 million

The loan was the asset; the notes were the liability. When the government spent those notes—paying soldiers, buying supplies, or funding allies—they became **money**, circulating through the economy as purchasing power. The Bank had, in effect, **created money by lending**.¹¹

To manage this revolutionary system, the Bank developed unprecedented institutional capacity. By the 1780s, approximately **300 clerks** maintained detailed asset-liability ledgers—**five times more** than the Treasury employed. This bureaucratic machinery, recording every transaction in double-entry format, was what made the Bank's promises credible. The ledgers were the foundation; the notes were merely their portable expression.¹²

### The mechanics of permanence

What made this system work was not the gold in the Bank's vaults but the **permanence** of the debt. The £1.2 million loan was not a short-term advance to be repaid when taxes came in. It was a **perpetual obligation**: the government would pay 8 percent interest every year, but it would never repay the principal unless it chose to. The Bank's shareholders were not creditors waiting for their money back; they were **rentiers**, earning a steady income from the state's promise to pay.¹³

This structure had profound implications. Because the debt was permanent, the Bank did not need to hold enough gold to redeem all its notes at once. It only needed to maintain confidence that notes were **convertible**—that anyone who wanted coin could get it. As long as most people preferred the convenience of paper, the Bank could issue far more notes than it held in specie. The difference was **credit**, created by double-entry bookkeeping and backed by the government's taxing power.¹⁴

Within three years, the funding model had evolved even further. By 1697, the Bank's balance sheet showed that **banknotes and bills outstanding made up the lion's share of its funding sources**—not shareholder capital. The Bank was issuing **non-interest-bearing notes** (essentially free money) to fund **interest-bearing government debt**, capturing the spread as profit. This was the birth of modern central banking: the alchemy of turning paper into gold by making promises credible.¹⁵

### The quid pro quo

The Bank's charter was not a gift; it was a **bargain**. In exchange for lending to the government on favorable terms, the Bank received privileges that made it the most powerful financial institution in England. Each charter renewal involved an explicit trade:

- **1697**: The Bank increased its capital by £1 million and received a monopoly clause prohibiting other banks by Act of Parliament.
- **1708**: The Bank made a £400,000 interest-free loan and gained a prohibition on partnerships of more than six persons from issuing notes—creating a de facto monopoly on joint-stock banking.
- **1742**: A £1.6 million interest-free loan reduced the interest rate on the total debt to 3 percent.
- **1800**: A £3 million interest-free loan for six years further extended the Bank's privileges.¹⁶

The pattern was consistent: the government granted monopoly power, and the Bank provided cheap credit. Neither side could afford to break the relationship. The Bank depended on its charter for legal authority; the government depended on the Bank for liquidity. The partnership was **symbiotic**, and it would endure for more than two centuries.¹⁷

Critically, the loans were **never closed out**. As a Bank of England Freedom of Information response confirmed in 2020: "When the Bank was founded in 1694 it lent £1.2 million to the government. Over the next 140 years the debt increased and decreased until in 1834 the amount outstanding was £11,015,100... When the Bank was nationalised in 1946 the outstanding balance was still £11,015,100."¹⁸ The debt rolled over indefinitely, with interest rates renegotiated but principal never repaid. This was not a bug but a feature: the permanence of the debt was what made the Bank's notes valuable.

### Why foreigners accepted it

The genius of the system was that it worked **both domestically and internationally**. At home, the Bank's notes circulated because they were redeemable in coin and accepted for taxes. Anyone who owed the Exchequer could pay in Bank notes, creating a baseline demand. The government's spending injected notes into the economy; taxation withdrew them. The cycle ensured that notes retained value, because everyone eventually needed them to satisfy obligations to the state.¹⁹

But why would **foreign creditors** accept this arrangement? Why would a Dutch merchant or a German banker lend to England when the debt was denominated in paper promises?

The answer lay in **parliamentary taxation**. Foreign lenders did not care about the Bank's notes per se; they cared about England's ability to **convert** those notes into gold or goods when needed. And that ability depended on the government's power to tax. Because Parliament legally controlled taxation, and because Parliament represented the wealthiest subjects, creditors could trust that England would always have the revenue to meet its obligations.²⁰

In other words:
- **Domestically**, taxation made the Bank's notes valuable by creating demand for them.
- **Internationally**, taxation made England's promises credible by demonstrating the state's capacity to pay.

This dual function—internal legitimacy and external solvency—was what made Britain's experiment succeed where France's absolutism failed. French kings borrowed more but defaulted often, because they lacked a representative body to secure revenues. England, after 1688, created the opposite model: **limited monarchy, unlimited credit**.²¹

### The triangle of trust

The Bank of England completed a self-reinforcing system that would define modern finance:

1. **The Bank created money** by lending to the state, issuing notes that circulated as currency.
2. **The state spent that money** into the economy, paying soldiers, suppliers, and allies.
3. **Taxation, authorized by Parliament**, withdrew money from circulation, controlled inflation, and guaranteed demand for the currency.

Each element depended on the others. The Bank's notes had value because the state accepted them for taxes. The state could borrow because the Bank provided liquidity. And Parliament could tax because it controlled both the state and the Bank through legal charter. The triangle was **closed**: no single actor could break it without destroying the system.²²

From a modern perspective, this was a profound institutionalization of the principle that **money is credit, and credit is trust**. The government did not need to hoard gold to create money; it needed only to make credible promises. Those promises were backed not by metal but by **law**—the legal power to tax, the legal obligation to pay, and the legal framework that bound them together.

### The evolution toward central banking

The Bank of England was not initially conceived as a "central bank" in the modern sense. It was a private joint-stock company that happened to serve the government. But over the next century, it would evolve functions that would define central banking for the world:

**Monopoly on note issuance**: Through successive charter renewals, the Bank gained exclusive rights to issue banknotes in England, creating a **uniform currency** that replaced the chaotic patchwork of private goldsmith notes. By the mid-18th century, "Bank of England note" and "money" had become nearly synonymous.²³

**Lender of last resort**: During financial panics, the Bank learned to provide emergency liquidity to solvent but illiquid banks, preventing cascading failures. This function—articulated theoretically by Henry Thornton in 1802 and Walter Bagehot in 1873—became the defining characteristic of central banking. The Bank held reserves not just for its own needs but as a **backstop for the entire system**.²⁴

**Manager of government debt**: The Bank became the government's fiscal agent, managing bond issuances, servicing debt payments, and coordinating with the Treasury. This relationship, formalized through repeated charter renewals, made the Bank indispensable to state finance.²⁵

These functions emerged gradually, through crisis and experimentation. But they established a template that other nations would follow. When Napoleon created the **Banque de France** in 1800 to stabilize currency after revolutionary hyperinflation, he explicitly modeled it on the Bank of England—a state-chartered institution with monopoly note-issuance and the mission of financing government. When the United States finally established the Federal Reserve in 1913, after decades of chaotic free banking, it too drew on the English precedent.²⁶

The Bank of England had invented a new institutional form: the **central bank** as a hybrid public-private entity, serving both commercial and sovereign functions, creating money through credit while maintaining convertibility through reserves. It was not the first bank to serve a government—Sweden's Riksbank predated it by 26 years. But it was the first to demonstrate that such an institution could survive war, crisis, and political upheaval while maintaining credibility. That lesson would reshape the world's monetary architecture.

### The legacy of 1694

The Bank of England's founding marked a turning point in monetary history. For the first time, a government had created an institution that could **manufacture credit on demand**, limited only by the need to maintain confidence. The Bank did not discover some hidden reserve of wealth; it **invented** wealth by making promises believable.

This was not alchemy in the mystical sense but in the practical one: the transformation of base materials (paper, ink, and ledgers) into something that functioned as gold. The trick was not in the paper but in the **institutions** that gave it meaning—Parliament's taxing power, the Bank's monopoly charter, and the legal framework that bound them.

Other nations would try to copy the model. Some, like the Netherlands, succeeded. Others, like France, failed because they lacked the constitutional foundations. The difference was always the same: **trust required institutions, and institutions required limits on arbitrary power**. A king who could dissolve Parliament or repudiate debts could never borrow as cheaply as a government that had surrendered those prerogatives.

The Bank of England proved that the future belonged not to the richest states but to the most **credible** ones. And credibility, it turned out, was not a matter of gold reserves but of legal architecture. The real revolution of 1688 was not political but financial: the discovery that **money is a relationship**, and relationships endure only when they are governed by rules no single party can break.
