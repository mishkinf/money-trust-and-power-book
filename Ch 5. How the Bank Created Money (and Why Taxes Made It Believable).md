# How the Bank Created Money (and Why Taxes Made It Believable)

The founding of the Bank of England marked a decisive shift in the nature of money: for the first time, a government could systematically create purchasing power without gold in hand. What gave that paper value was not metal, but institutional trust — specifically, Parliament’s power to tax and the Bank’s disciplined bookkeeping.

Double-Entry: How Money Was Created from Debt
When the Bank first lent its £1.2 million to William III’s government, no one dug up gold. Instead, clerks opened ledgers and made two entries:
Assets
Liabilities
Loan to the Government £1,200,000
Banknotes Issued £1,200,000

That simple double-entry — a promise to the government on one side, a promise to the public on the other — brought new money into being. The government spent those notes on wages, provisions, and war materials. As they circulated, the notes became the medium of exchange for private transactions too.
In modern terms, the Bank was performing open-market operations before the concept existed: turning public debt into liquid money. The crucial difference was that every pound issued corresponded to a loan to the state, and the state’s ability to repay rested on Parliament’s taxation power.

Taxes and the Logic of Confidence
From an MMT perspective, taxation here played two distinct roles:
Domestic anchor of value. Because taxes were legally payable only in sterling, every household and merchant needed pounds. This created constant demand for the Bank’s notes, ensuring they circulated and retained value even though they were, in substance, government IOUs.
Signal of solvency to investors and foreign powers. Abroad, the existence of regular, law-bound taxation convinced lenders that England could meet its obligations. They didn’t expect to pay those taxes themselves; they cared that Parliament could compel others to do so. That power made redemption in gold credible, not inevitable.


In effect, Parliament’s ability to tax its citizens guaranteed that England would not default. As long as taxes flowed in, the Bank could redeem its notes and service the debt. Thus, taxation and convertibility formed a dual system of trust — domestic obedience on one side, international confidence on the other.

Gold as External Discipline
Why, then, did England bother tying its currency to gold at all? Because trade and war were international. Foreign merchants, soldiers, and governments didn’t pay English taxes; they needed something universally acceptable. Gold and silver served as the bridge between national credit systems.
When the Bank issued more notes than the market trusted, specie drained out; when confidence rose, gold flowed back in. This automatic adjustment made gold a form of external discipline — not the true “backing” of money, but a way to keep international settlements stable. The domestic anchor was taxation; the international anchor was gold. Together they sustained what later economists called “sound money.”

A New Kind of Sovereignty
In this structure, sovereignty became institutional rather than personal. The king no longer conjured money by decree; Parliament and the Bank generated it by rule. The process was, in today’s language, a consolidated balance sheet:
The Treasury spent first.
The Bank created matching liabilities (notes or deposits).
Taxes later destroyed part of that money, keeping the system in equilibrium.


This was the core insight that later underpinned both classical economics and, centuries later, Modern Monetary Theory: the state doesn’t “get” money from the public — it issues money to the public, and taxation serves to maintain its value, not to fund it.
