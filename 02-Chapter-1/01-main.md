# The Origins of Money and the Birth of Credit

The smell of barley dust filled the air inside the temple granary of Uruk. A scribe, reed stylus in hand, pressed wedge-shaped marks into a damp clay tablet. Each mark recorded a promise—how much grain a farmer owed after harvest, or what portion the temple would distribute to workers digging irrigation canals. When the scribe finished, he set the tablet aside to dry in the sun. The hardened clay became both contract and currency, a permanent memory of obligation. That scene, repeated thousands of times across the Tigris and Euphrates valleys five thousand years ago, was the beginning of money.¹

For centuries economists assumed money was born from barter—hunters trading hides for grain, shepherds for wine. But the tablets of Mesopotamia tell another story. The first “currencies” were not objects at all but **records of debt**, created and enforced by central institutions—temples, palaces, and later the state.² Those institutions measured value in a common unit—silver by weight—but few ever touched the metal. Instead, they kept running tallies of who owed what to whom. The unit of account came first; the coin arrived millennia later.³

### The age of sacred accounting

Temples in Sumer and Babylon functioned as economic hubs. They owned land, received tithes, issued rations, and extended credit to farmers who needed seed or tools. Hudson calls them *"palatial balance-sheet economies"*—centralized systems where temples and palaces functioned as both banks and accounting offices, tracking debts and credits across the entire society. They lent resources during planting season and reclaimed them at harvest through taxes or interest in kind. To keep society from collapsing under compound debt, rulers periodically proclaimed *amargi*—debt cancellation or "clean-slate" jubilees.⁴ Money here was not a spontaneous market medium but a **political technology of accounting and control**.

Think of a Mesopotamian temple as a community bank where your account balance existed only as marks on a clay tablet. You delivered ten bushels of barley at harvest. The priest scratched marks into wet clay: "Farmer Enlil: +10 barley." Six months later, you needed seed grain. The priest scratched: "Farmer Enlil: -3 barley." Your wealth existed not as grain sitting in a storehouse with your name on it, but as the **difference between the marks**. The temple might lend your barley to someone else while you were not using it. What mattered was not the physical grain—it was the temple's record that you had a claim. Money was born as **accounting**, not as things.

Egypt followed a similar model. Grain stored in state granaries served as both sustenance and standard of value. Taxes were payable in wheat; officials recorded deposits and withdrawals in the same units. A worker’s wage, a priest’s tithe, and a merchant’s payment could all be expressed in *hekats* of grain even if no grain changed hands. The economy’s stability depended less on metal than on bureaucracy—the scribes’ ability to maintain balanced ledgers.⁵

### Credit before coin

China’s earliest dynasties show the same pattern. By the first millennium BCE, the Zhou court kept elaborate registers of tribute and land rent. Paper instruments appeared by the Tang and Song eras: lightweight *jiaozi* notes redeemable in coin or goods, originally issued by merchant guilds and later monopolized by the state. The government accepted these notes for taxes, giving them legal value—proof that fiat currency long predates modern central banks.⁶

In all these societies, the essence of money was **trust**, not metal. As long as the authority that issued the credit could also collect taxes, its promises held. When that authority weakened—through war, drought, or rebellion—the notes lost value. Money's history, in other words, is inseparable from sovereignty.

### The metallist challenge

The credit-first interpretation faces a serious intellectual challenge from the **metallist** school, which argues that money must have originated from commodity exchange. The strongest version of this argument comes from Ludwig von Mises's **Regression Theorem** (1912), which presents what appears to be a logical proof that credit money is impossible without prior commodity money.

Mises reasoned as follows: money's value today depends on people's expectation of its purchasing power tomorrow. Tomorrow's value depends on the next day's expectation, and so on. Tracing this chain backward, we eventually reach a day when the monetary commodity had only **commodity value**—when gold was valued for jewelry or silver for tableware, before either circulated as money. This, Mises argued, proves that money **must** originate from a commodity with prior use-value. It cannot emerge from government fiat or pure credit, because there would be no way to "bootstrap" the initial value.⁶ᵃ

The argument is elegant and has never been fully refuted on its own terms. Carl Menger, founder of the Austrian School, made a similar point in 1892: money emerged as "the spontaneous outcome, the unpremeditated resultant, of particular, individual efforts" as people gradually recognized certain commodities' superior "saleableness." This spontaneous-order narrative directly contradicts the state-creation theory.⁶ᵇ

The archaeological evidence from Mesopotamia admits alternative interpretations. While temple ledgers clearly recorded debts, those debts were often denominated in **silver by weight**—the shekel was originally a unit of weight, not a coin. Physical artifacts include "spiral coils of silver, lengths of which were snipped off to pay debts." Denise Schmandt-Besserat's research on 8,162 clay tokens from the fourth millennium BCE shows each token represented "a specified quantity of a particular commodity"—suggesting commodity-based accounting rather than pure abstraction.⁶ᶜ

Metallists argue that even temple "credits" were ultimately claims on actual stored commodities, not pure abstractions. The requirement that temple notes be convertible to grain or silver means they differed fundamentally from modern fiat currency. The unit of account may have been abstract, but the settlement medium was tangible. This interpretation suggests that credit and commodity money coevolved rather than credit preceding commodity entirely.⁶ᵈ

The debate matters because it shapes how we understand money's essential nature. If metallists are correct that money must originate from commodity value, then fiat currency is a recent deviation from money's natural form—a deviation that might prove unsustainable. If chartalists are correct that money originated as credit backed by institutional authority, then commodity money was merely a transitional phase, and fiat currency represents a return to money's original form.

The evidence presented in this chapter supports the chartalist interpretation: sophisticated credit systems operated for centuries before widespread commodity money, and taxation authority—not commodity backing—drove currency acceptance. But intellectual honesty requires acknowledging the metallist challenge. The Regression Theorem identifies a real puzzle: how does purely abstract money acquire initial value? The chartalist answer—that state power to tax creates value from the start—is theoretically coherent but historically difficult to prove for the earliest monetary systems.

What the evidence does show conclusively is that once monetary systems were established, **institutional credibility mattered more than commodity backing**. Temple credits worked when temples were powerful; they failed when temples weakened. Tally sticks worked when the English crown could enforce taxation; they were worthless abroad where that power didn't reach. The pattern holds across millennia: trust in institutions, not faith in metal, determined whether money functioned.⁶ᵉ

### From temple to marketplace

As trade expanded across political boundaries, trust in any single ruler’s IOU waned. A Mesopotamian merchant sending tin to Anatolia or a Greek trader buying grain in Egypt needed a medium others would accept without knowing him. Gold and silver—rare, durable, divisible—fit that role. They were *neutral collateral*, a kind of universal passport of value. Coins, first struck in Lydia around 600 BCE, stamped that neutrality with royal authority: the image of a lion or king guaranteed weight and purity. Metal money thus emerged not to replace credit but to bridge **zones of unfamiliarity**—the space between temples, cities, and empires.⁷

Within each realm, however, credit persisted. Greek city-states maintained public ledgers; Rome’s *aerarium* kept accounts of taxes and expenditures; local bankers issued transfer orders recorded on wax tablets. The coexistence of credit and coin became a permanent feature of monetary life.

### Medieval continuities

When Rome fell, Europe’s coin supply shrank, but the logic of accounting survived. Manorial economies of the early Middle Ages ran on obligations recorded in rents, tithes, and corvée labor. Most peasants paid their dues **in kind**—grain, wool, or days worked on the lord’s fields. Where markets existed, they relied on memory and tally. The English Exchequer used **tally sticks** from the twelfth century onward: a notched hazel rod split lengthwise so that debtor and creditor each held a matching record. When a taxpayer delivered grain or coin to the crown, the sheriff’s tally was “struck off,” and the stick itself could circulate as payment to someone else. A 1290 record reads: *“Delivered to Roger of Suffolk one tally for one hundred shillings due from the sheriff of Kent.”*⁸ The tally was both receipt and transferable credit—state-backed paper without paper.

By accepting these instruments for taxes, the crown gave them life. By keeping them on its books, it ensured their redemption. For ordinary people, a split stick was as good as silver because it satisfied the one debt that mattered most: what they owed the king.⁹

Yet this power had a fatal limitation: tally sticks could discharge obligations only within the realm. The distinction between domestic instruments backed by tax authority and international instruments requiring exportable value would haunt European monarchs for centuries and ultimately drive the creation of central banks.

### **Chapter Summary**

Money began not as commodity but as credit—recorded obligations managed by central institutions. From Mesopotamian temple ledgers to Chinese paper notes to English tally sticks, societies created money through accounting systems backed by taxation authority. Credit preceded coin by millennia. The medium mattered less than the institutional capacity to impose and enforce obligations. This pattern—credit instruments circulating domestically based on tax authority—worked within sovereign borders but failed across them, setting up the fiscal crisis that would drive the creation of central banks.

### The long arc of trust

From the clay tablets of Uruk to the gold guineas of London, money’s evolution traces a single thread: the quest to make obligations transferable through time and space. In stable communities, shared faith and record-keeping suffice. Across frontiers, neutrality must be minted or guaranteed. Every monetary innovation—grain ledgers, tally sticks, coins, banknotes—solved the same problem at a new scale: **how to make promises believable beyond the circle of personal trust.**

That problem never vanished. Modern fiat currency, backed by a central bank’s balance sheet and a government’s taxing power, still depends on confidence. Its value endures not because of the paper or digits themselves but because citizens believe taxes can always be paid and debts enforced in that unit. The lineage is direct: today’s Treasury security is yesterday’s tally stick written in digital code.

Money, then, is not a thing but a **relationship**—a ledger of mutual recognition between issuer and user. Its stability has always rested on institutions capable of keeping that ledger honest. When those institutions falter, people reach for metal, foreign currency, or barter. When they function, trust alone suffices.

The birth of credit in the temples of Mesopotamia was therefore not a primitive stage on the road to coin but the first expression of a deeper truth: economies are systems of faith organized through record-keeping. From sacred accounting to sovereign finance, every regime of money has been an attempt to balance two imperatives—**the freedom to create credit** and **the need to make it credible**. That tension, first written in clay five millennia ago, still defines the world’s monetary order.
