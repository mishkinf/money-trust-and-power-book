# The Breaking: From Gold to Fiat

The news reached London on February 25, 1797: French troops had landed at Fishguard, Wales. The invasion force was small—fourteen hundred men, mostly convicts and irregulars—and would be captured within days. But panic spread faster than facts. By dawn on February 26, crowds gathered outside the Bank of England, demanding gold. The Bank's reserves, already depleted by years of war finance, could not withstand a sustained run. That afternoon, the Privy Council met in emergency session. By evening, they had made a decision that would have been unthinkable a generation earlier: **suspend gold convertibility**. The Bank of England, for 103 years the guarantor of sterling's value in metal, would no longer redeem its notes for coin.¹

The suspension was announced as temporary—"until six weeks after the conclusion of peace." It would last **twenty-four years**. During that time, Britain would fight and win the Napoleonic Wars, finance the largest military mobilization in its history, and prove that paper money could function without gold backing—if the institutions behind it were credible enough. The Bank Restriction Act, as it came to be known, was the first successful experiment in **fiat currency** by a major power. It worked not because of gold but despite its absence.²

### The crisis of 1797

The French landing was merely the trigger. The real crisis had been building for years. Britain's war against revolutionary France, begun in 1793, had drained the Bank's gold reserves from **£8 million** in 1791 to less than **£1 million** by February 1797. War spending, poor harvests requiring grain imports, and provincial bank runs had all contributed. By the time panic hit London, the Bank's notes in circulation—**£10,865,050**—were almost exactly **twice** its gold reserves of **£5,322,010**.³

Under normal circumstances, this would not have mattered. Most people preferred the convenience of paper to the weight of metal. But war created abnormal circumstances. Merchants needed gold to pay for foreign supplies. Investors sought safety in tangible assets. And once a run began, it fed on itself: the more people demanded gold, the more others feared the Bank would run out, prompting them to demand gold too.⁴

The Privy Council's decision to suspend convertibility was pragmatic, not principled. The alternative was worse: if the Bank exhausted its reserves, it would fail, taking the entire financial system with it. Better to preserve the institution and hope that confidence in paper could be maintained long enough to win the war and restore gold payments afterward.⁵

What happened next surprised everyone. The Bank's notes did not collapse in value. Prices rose—eventually by about **50 percent** between 1797 and 1801—but this was moderate inflation, not hyperinflation. The pound's exchange rate against foreign currencies fell, but it did not crash. And most remarkably, **people continued to accept Bank notes** for everyday transactions, even knowing they could not be redeemed for gold.⁶

### Why paper held its value

The success of the Bank Restriction Act was not inevitable. France's assignats, issued during the Revolution, had collapsed into worthlessness within five years. The American Continental dollar had suffered the same fate during the Revolutionary War. Why did British paper money succeed where others had failed?⁷

The answer lay in **institutional credibility**. The Bank of England, unlike France's revolutionary government or America's Continental Congress, had a century-long track record of prudent management. It had never defaulted, never hyperinflated, never betrayed the trust placed in it. When convertibility was suspended, the public believed it was temporary—and that belief was rational, based on the Bank's history.⁸

Several factors reinforced confidence:

**1. Merchant support**: On February 28, 1797—the day after suspension—London's leading merchants issued a public statement declaring their willingness to accept Bank notes "as readily as gold." This was not altruism but self-interest: the merchants needed the financial system to function, and that required maintaining confidence in paper.⁹

**2. Credible commitment**: The suspension was framed as temporary, "until six weeks after the conclusion of peace." This gave the public a clear endpoint and a reason to believe that gold convertibility would eventually resume. The government did not claim the power to print money indefinitely; it claimed only the necessity of suspending convertibility during wartime emergency.¹⁰

**3. Fiscal backing**: In 1798, Prime Minister William Pitt introduced Britain's first **income tax**—a direct levy on earnings that demonstrated the government's capacity to raise revenue. This was crucial: foreign creditors and domestic holders of government debt needed assurance that Britain could service its obligations. The income tax provided that assurance, showing that the state had untapped fiscal capacity.¹¹

**4. War success**: Britain ultimately won the Napoleonic Wars, validating the public's confidence. Had Britain lost, the Bank's notes would likely have collapsed. But victory vindicated the suspension, proving that the government's promises—even when not backed by gold—could be trusted.¹²

### The Bullionist Controversy

Not everyone accepted the suspension quietly. By 1809, with prices rising and the pound's exchange rate falling, a fierce debate erupted over monetary policy. The **Bullionists**, led by economist David Ricardo, argued that the Bank had issued too many notes, causing inflation and currency depreciation. The solution, they insisted, was to restore gold convertibility immediately, forcing the Bank to contract its note issue.¹³

The **Anti-Bullionists**, including the Bank's directors and government officials, blamed external factors: poor harvests, food imports, and subsidies to continental allies. They argued that the Bank had merely accommodated the "needs of trade" by discounting legitimate commercial paper. According to the **Real Bills Doctrine**, as long as the Bank lent only against good collateral, its note issue could not cause inflation—it would simply follow the economy's real demand for money.¹⁴

In June 1810, a Parliamentary Select Committee chaired by Francis Horner issued the **Bullion Report**, siding decisively with the Bullionists. The Report blamed the Bank for not contracting note issue and rejected the Real Bills Doctrine as "wholly erroneous in principle, and pregnant with dangerous consequences in practice." It recommended restoring convertibility within two years.¹⁵

Parliament rejected the Report's recommendations by large majorities. The war was not yet won; the government needed continued access to Bank credit; and most MPs feared that a sudden contraction would cause economic hardship. The debate raged on, but policy remained unchanged.¹⁶

### Henry Thornton's genius

Amid the controversy, one voice stood out for its analytical clarity: **Henry Thornton**, a banker and MP who in 1802 had published *An Inquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain*. Thornton's book is arguably the most important work of monetary economics before the 20th century, anticipating insights that would not be formalized for another hundred years.¹⁷

Thornton's key contributions:

**The two-interest-rate model**: Thornton distinguished between the Bank's lending rate and the "current rate of mercantile profit." If the Bank's rate was too low relative to profit opportunities, borrowing would expand indefinitely, driving inflation. This was the foundation for all subsequent theories of the "natural rate" of interest, including Knut Wicksell's cumulative process (1898).¹⁸

**Lender of last resort**: Thornton argued that the Bank should hold large reserves and lend freely during financial panics ("internal drains"), but distinguish between temporary liquidity crises and permanent external drains that required gold outflows. This doctrine, later refined by Walter Bagehot, became the cornerstone of central banking practice.¹⁹

**Discretionary policy**: Thornton advocated flexible monetary management, recognizing that rigid rules could not account for changing circumstances. But by 1810, observing the Bank's behavior during the Restriction, he concluded that discretion needed legal constraints—the Bank could not be trusted to manage itself without external discipline.²⁰

**On deflation**: Thornton warned that "a very great and sudden reduction in the accustomed number of bank notes" would create "unusual and temporary distress" and "discouragement of the fabrication of manufactures." He understood what later economists would call the **sticky wages** problem: prices and wages do not adjust instantly to monetary contraction, so deflation causes real economic pain.²¹

Thornton's work was largely ignored by his contemporaries, who preferred simpler theories. But his insights would prove prophetic when Britain finally restored gold convertibility in 1821.

### The return to gold

The Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815 with Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo. But the Bank Restriction continued for six more years, as Parliament debated how and when to restore convertibility. The **Peel's Act** of 1819 set a phased schedule: resumption in gold ingots (not coin) beginning May 1, 1821, with full coin redemption deferred until 1823.²²

The Bank, eager to demonstrate its soundness, began voluntary partial resumption in January 1817. By May 1821—two years ahead of the legal deadline—full convertibility was restored. The pound was back on gold at its pre-1797 parity: **£3 17s 10½d per ounce** of standard gold.²³

The economic consequences were severe. To restore the pound's value, the Bank had to contract its note issue dramatically. Note circulation fell from **£28.4 million** in 1814 (backed by only **£2.2 million** in gold) to **£2.3 million** in 1821 (backed by **£11.2 million** in gold). The ratio had completely reversed.²⁴ In contemporary terms, the 1814 note circulation represented approximately **9.5% of British GDP**, while gold reserves were only **0.7%**—a note-to-gold ratio of 12.9:1. By 1821, note circulation had contracted to just **0.6% of GDP** while gold reserves rose to **3.0%**—a staggering **92% reduction** in circulating money over seven years.²⁴ᵃ

Prices collapsed. The general price index fell from **150** at the end of 1818 to **120** by early 1821 and **104** by mid-1824. Farmers, who had borrowed during the inflationary war years, found themselves repaying loans in appreciated currency—their debts had effectively increased in real terms. Industrial unemployment spiked, especially in Birmingham's metal-working trades. Contemporary Thomas Attwood declared that Peel's Act had created "more misery, more poverty, more discord, more of everything that was calamitous to the nation, except death, than Attila caused in the Roman Empire."²⁵

The human cost was staggering. Wheat prices had averaged 108 shillings per quarter in 1813; by 1822 they had collapsed to 45 shillings—a 60 percent drop.²⁵ᵃ A farmer who borrowed £500 during the war years to expand his acreage faced a debt burden that had effectively doubled in real terms. His income had been cut in half, yet his obligations remained fixed. In February 1822, MP John Gooch reported to Parliament that petitions from Suffolk showed "one unusual scene of distress" among farmers.²⁵ᵇ David Ricardo, writing from Paris in December 1821, observed that "the farmers—theirs is a pitiable situation" with no relief except "the liberality of their landlords" who were themselves "in a state of suffering."²⁵ᶜ

The London Gazette's insolvency lists tell the story in names: John Griffin, "formerly of Ogbourn St. George, farmer" in Wiltshire; John Wiltshire of Warboys, "farmer and labourer" in Huntingdonshire.²⁵ᵈ These were men who had done nothing wrong—had worked harder than ever—but monetary policy had made their debts unpayable. William Cobbett, touring southern England in late 1822, found farmers who had bought lambs for 24 shillings each and sold them two years later for 8 shillings—losses of £120 plus interest on borrowed capital.²⁵ᵉ Many tenant farmers lost their land; laborers turned to poor relief as wages fell. By May 1822, MP Matthias Attwood warned that without relief, "a great portion of the land at present under cultivation must of necessity be abandoned" with "the destruction of the farmers and labourers."²⁵ᶠ

The policy had been designed to restore Britain's "honour"—to prove that the pound's value was as solid as gold. But honour was an abstraction. For the farmers named in insolvency proceedings and the thousands more who suffered in silence, the policy was a disaster that destroyed livelihoods and families. The gold standard had been restored, but at a human cost that economists measuring price indices could not capture.

Even David Ricardo, the leading advocate of resumption, criticized the Bank for contracting too rapidly. "The evils of the time," he wrote, "arose from the Bank's not having followed his advice" for gradual reduction. The deflation was unnecessary—a policy choice, not an economic necessity.²⁶

Yet despite the short-term pain, resumption succeeded. Britain remained on the gold standard until 1914, making sterling the world's reserve currency for a century. The "honour of the country and stability of its institutions" had been restored, in the words of economic historian Frank Fetter. The gold standard had survived its first great test.²⁷

### Churchill's blunder

A century later, Britain would face the same choice—and make the opposite mistake. On April 28, 1925, Chancellor of the Exchequer **Winston Churchill** announced Britain's return to the gold standard at the pre-war parity of **$4.86 per pound**. The decision was hailed as a restoration of normalcy after the chaos of World War I. It was, in fact, a catastrophic error.²⁸

The problem was simple: the market exchange rate in January 1925 had been **$4.77**. The official parity represented approximately **10 percent overvaluation**. British exports would be 10 percent more expensive to foreign buyers; British imports would be 10 percent cheaper. To restore competitiveness, British wages and prices would have to fall by 10 percent—a massive deflationary adjustment.²⁹

John Maynard Keynes, in a scathing pamphlet titled "The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill" (July 1925), predicted the consequences with precision:

- 10 percent reduction in export receipts
- Transfer of **£1 billion** from productive workers to rentiers (bondholders)
- Increased real burden of the National Debt by **£750 million**
- Deflation, unemployment, and social unrest³⁰

Every prediction came true. The coal industry, heavily dependent on exports, was hit first. Coal miners faced wage cuts; when they refused, mine owners locked them out. The dispute escalated into the **General Strike of 1926**—the largest industrial action in British history, with approximately **1.5-1.75 million workers** striking (roughly **7-8% of the British workforce**) in support of **1.2 million locked-out coal miners**.³¹ The overvalued pound drained gold reserves, forcing the Bank of England to maintain tight monetary policy. Unemployment remained high throughout 1925-1931.

Councillor Hugh Reynolds, a coalminer at Plean Colliery in Stirlingshire, experienced the lockout firsthand. By 1926 Reynolds was married with a wife and one young child.³¹ᵃ When mine owners demanded a 13 percent wage cut plus an extra hour per day in April 1926, Reynolds and his fellow miners refused.³¹ᵇ They had already endured years of wage stagnation—South Wales miners averaged only £2 13s 6d per week in 1925, far below the £3-4 often claimed.³¹ᶜ The lockout began May 1. The TUC called a General Strike in solidarity, but after nine days abandoned the miners, who remained locked out for seven more months—through November 1926.³¹ᵈ

Reynolds's family survived on 18 shillings worth of groceries per week—a voucher that barely fed three people.³¹ᵉ Even this meager relief was a loan: Reynolds later had to repay it at 1 shilling per week from his post-strike wages. Throughout the lockout, families survived on soup kitchens, charity, and community solidarity.³¹ᶠ Many went hungry. In November, with winter approaching and no resolution in sight, the miners were "finally starved into submission and forced to accept the owners' terms."³¹ᵍ They returned to work at the reduced wage—13 percent less than before—with an eight-hour day. Reynolds would spend the rest of his working life earning less, knowing the wage cut had nothing to do with productivity or market conditions. It was the price of Churchill's decision to value the pound's prestige over workers' livelihoods.

The lockout affected over 1.5 million workers. For families like the Reynolds, it meant months of hardship—reduced meals, unpaid rent, children going hungry. The strike was eventually broken, but the bitterness lingered. The gold standard had been restored, but at the cost of industrial peace and working-class living standards. Monetary policy, supposedly a technical matter for experts, had become a weapon in class conflict. The overvalued pound enriched bondholders and impoverished workers, redistributing wealth upward while economists debated exchange rate theory.

On September 21, 1931, Britain was forced off gold again. The experiment had lasted six years and accomplished nothing except economic hardship. Churchill later called it "the biggest blunder of my life." He should have either returned at a lower parity reflecting wartime inflation, or waited until prices adjusted naturally. Instead, he chose prestige over pragmatism—and Britain paid the price.³²

### The gold sinks

Britain's mistake was compounded by a global catastrophe: the **maldistribution of gold** in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Two countries—France and the United States—accumulated vast gold reserves while the rest of the world starved for liquidity. The result was the Great Depression.³³

France's share of world gold reserves rose from **7 percent** in 1926 to **27 percent** by 1932. By the Depression's depth, France held nearly as much gold as the United States, despite having an economy one-quarter the size. The causes were multiple: an undervalued franc (from the 1926 Poincaré stabilization), legal requirements that the Bank of France convert foreign exchange into gold, and a mandated **35 percent minimum gold cover ratio** that the Bank exceeded, reaching **80 percent** by 1932.³⁴

The United States contributed to the problem by **sterilizing** gold inflows between 1928 and 1930. When gold flowed into America, the Federal Reserve should have allowed the money supply to expand, raising prices and wages. Instead, it prevented monetary expansion, hoarding the gold while the rest of the world deflated.³⁵

Economist Douglas Irwin quantified the disaster. Between 1927 and 1932:

- World gold stock grew **24 percent**
- U.S. share increased **1 percent**
- France's share increased **24 percent**
- Rest of world: **0 percent**³⁶

By 1932, the U.S. and France held over **60 percent** of the world's monetary gold. Keynes called France a "gold sink." The phrase was apt: gold flowed in but did not circulate, trapped by legal requirements and central bank policy.³⁷

The impact on prices was devastating. Wholesale prices fell **34 percent** between 1928 and 1932. Irwin's analysis shows that U.S. and French gold hoarding explains approximately **40 percent** of this deflation. The gold standard, designed to provide stability, had become an engine of destruction.³⁸

Contemporary economists warned of the danger. Gustav Cassel, Keynes, and Allyn Young all predicted catastrophe if gold hoarding continued. They were ignored. Central bankers, trained to worship gold, could not imagine that their devotion to the metal was strangling the world economy.³⁹

### Roosevelt's revolution

On March 5, 1933, newly inaugurated President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared a **bank holiday**, closing every bank in America. The Emergency Banking Act, passed that same day, invalidated gold redemption. On April 5, Executive Order 6102 went further: it **banned private gold ownership**, requiring citizens to surrender gold coins, bullion, and certificates to the Federal Reserve by May 1. The penalty for non-compliance: **$10,000 fine** and/or **10 years imprisonment**. Only about 20-25 percent of gold was actually surrendered, but the message was clear: the gold standard was dead.⁴⁰

On January 30, 1934, the Gold Reserve Act formalized the new order:

- All monetary gold in the U.S. was **nationalized**
- The official price was set at **$35 per ounce** (from $20.67 since 1834)
- The dollar was **devalued** to 59.06 percent of its former value
- Gold redemption by Treasury and banks was **prohibited**
- Gold clauses in contracts were **abrogated**⁴¹

Critics called it default. The Supreme Court, in the *Consolidated Gold Clause Cases* (1935), narrowly upheld the government's actions. But the economic effects were undeniable: gold inflows accelerated, the money supply grew **10 percent annually** from 1933 to 1937, and GDP growth averaged over **8 percent** annually during the same period. The recovery from the Depression had begun.⁴²

Roosevelt's policies were controversial and remain so. But they demonstrated a crucial truth: **gold was not necessary for monetary stability**. What mattered was the government's ability to manage the money supply, maintain employment, and restore confidence. Gold had been a constraint, not a foundation.

---

### Bretton Woods: the dollar's triumph

The final act came in July 1944, as Allied forces fought across Normandy. At the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, 730 delegates from 44 nations gathered to design the postwar monetary system. Two visions competed: John Maynard Keynes's **International Clearing Union** with a supranational currency called bancor, and Harry Dexter White's dollar-centered system backed by American gold.⁴³

Keynes's plan was elegant and ambitious:

- A world central bank with supranational authority
- Bancor as international currency (not gold or any national currency)
- Quotas proportionate to trade volume
- **Symmetrical adjustment**: countries with persistent surpluses would be penalized, putting pressure on both deficit and surplus countries⁴⁴

White's plan was simpler and reflected American power:

- Fixed exchange rates: each currency pegged to the dollar within ±1 percent
- Dollar convertible to gold at **$35 per ounce**
- International Monetary Fund to provide short-term liquidity
- No penalty for surplus countries⁴⁵

White won. America held two-thirds of the world's monetary gold and was the only major economy whose infrastructure had not been destroyed by war. The dollar would be "as good as gold," and other currencies would be as good as dollars. The system was not truly a gold standard—only the U.S. owed gold, and only to foreign central banks, not to private citizens. It was a **dollar standard** with gold as window dressing.⁴⁶

The Bretton Woods system lasted 27 years. It facilitated postwar reconstruction, enabled the expansion of international trade, and provided monetary stability. But it contained a fatal flaw: the **Triffin dilemma**. For the world to have enough dollars for trade and reserves, the U.S. had to run balance-of-payments deficits. But persistent deficits undermined confidence in dollar-gold convertibility. The system required the U.S. to be simultaneously strong (to maintain gold convertibility) and weak (to supply dollars to the world).⁴⁷

---

### The Nixon Shock

By the late 1960s, the contradiction was unsustainable. The Vietnam War and Great Society programs had created large U.S. deficits. Dollars accumulated in foreign central banks, far exceeding U.S. gold reserves. In 1971, France and other countries began demanding gold, testing America's commitment to convertibility.⁴⁸

On August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon appeared on television to announce that the United States would "temporarily" suspend dollar convertibility to gold. The announcement was a shock—no warning had been given to foreign governments or even to most U.S. officials. But it was also inevitable. The U.S. simply did not have enough gold to redeem all outstanding dollar claims.⁴⁹

The suspension was announced as temporary. It became permanent. By 1973, the Bretton Woods system had collapsed entirely. Major currencies began floating against each other, their values determined by market forces rather than fixed parities. For the first time in history, the world's monetary system was based entirely on **fiat currency**—money backed by nothing but government decree and public confidence.⁵⁰

The gold standard, which had dominated monetary thinking for two centuries, was dead. And remarkably, the world did not collapse. Inflation rose in the 1970s, but it was eventually controlled. Trade continued to expand. Financial markets adapted to floating exchange rates. The lesson was clear: **gold had never been necessary**. What mattered was institutional credibility, fiscal capacity, and the ability to manage monetary policy. These were human creations, not natural laws.⁵¹

---

### The liberation from gold

From the Bank Restriction Act of 1797 to the Nixon Shock of 1971, the story of money's evolution was a story of **institutional learning**. Each crisis revealed the same truth: gold was not the foundation of monetary value; trust was. And trust could be built without gold—if the institutions were credible, if the government could tax and spend responsibly, if the central bank managed the money supply prudently.⁵²

The breaking of the gold standard was not a failure but a **liberation**. It freed governments to pursue full employment, to respond to economic crises without being constrained by arbitrary metal reserves, to recognize that money was a tool for human purposes rather than a natural phenomenon to be worshipped. The transition was painful and often mismanaged. But it was necessary.⁵³

What remained was the challenge that had always existed: how to maintain trust in money when it was no longer backed by anything tangible. The answer, as Britain had discovered in 1797 and America rediscovered in 1971, lay in **institutions**—in central banks that managed money supply responsibly, in governments that taxed and spent within sustainable limits, in legal frameworks that protected property and enforced contracts. Money was a social technology, and like all technologies, it worked only when the underlying systems were sound.⁵⁴

The gold standard had been an accident, created by Newton's mathematics and sustained by British power. Its collapse was equally accidental, driven by war, depression, and the contradictions inherent in trying to base a growing global economy on a fixed supply of metal. What emerged from the wreckage was something more honest: money as a **human institution**, created by law and sustained by trust, serving the needs of the economy rather than constraining it. The breaking was complete. The age of fiat had begun.⁵⁵

The age of pure fiat had begun, but its architecture was still being built. How would central banks manage money creation without gold's constraint? How would governments maintain fiscal discipline without automatic limits? How would international coordination work without fixed exchange rates? These questions would shape the next half-century, as the world learned to operate a monetary system based entirely on institutional credibility. The answers would emerge through crisis and experimentation, revealing both the power and the fragility of money sustained by trust alone.

---

### **Chapter Summary**

The gold standard broke in three stages: 1797 (Bank Restriction Act suspended convertibility during Napoleonic Wars), 1914-1925 (World War I forced suspension, disastrous return at pre-war parity), and 1971 (Nixon closed gold window permanently). Each break revealed gold's limitations. The 1797-1821 suspension proved paper money could function without metal backing if institutions were credible—Bank of England notes circulated successfully for 24 years. The 1821 return to gold at pre-war parity caused devastating deflation: note circulation contracted 92%, wheat prices fell 58%, farmers faced insolvency. Churchill's 1925 return at $4.86 (10% overvalued) triggered the 1926 General Strike affecting 1.7 million workers and forced miners to accept 13% wage cuts. The gold standard imposed deflationary bias, redistributed wealth from debtors to creditors, and constrained policy responses to economic crises. Nixon's 1971 decision ended the system permanently, proving fiat money could work if institutions were credible. The lesson: money is institutional, not commodity-based—trust matters more than metal.
