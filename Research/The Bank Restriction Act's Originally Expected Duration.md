# The Bank Restriction Act's Originally Expected Duration: Correcting the "Six Weeks" Claim

The claim that British officials expected the Bank Restriction Act of 1797 to last "six weeks" when enacted cannot be substantiated by primary source evidence. **The suspension was initially announced to last one year**, though the statutory text specified a shorter initial period ending June 24, 1797—approximately seven to eight weeks from the Act's passage. This finding resolves a persistent historical misconception by establishing what contemporary sources actually documented about duration expectations.

## The definitive answer: One year, not six weeks

The most authoritative recent scholarship explicitly contradicts the "six weeks" claim. Patrick K. O'Brien and Nuno Palma, in their comprehensive 2020 study published in the *European Review of Economic History*, state unequivocally: **"While initially announced that it was to last one year, it was later decided that the suspension of convertibility was to be extended until a definite peace had been signed."** This conclusion appears consistently across multiple versions of their work, including their 2016 working paper and the 2020 published article. The authors base this assertion on extensive research in primary sources including Clapham's authoritative histories of the Bank of England and Parliamentary records.

The statutory reality differs slightly from the announced duration. Parliamentary records from 1819 documenting the suspension's history state: "Its duration was limited by the first act, which received the royal assent on the 3d of May, 1797, to the 24th of June following." This established an initial statutory expiration approximately **seven to eight weeks** (52 days) after passage—close to, but distinct from, six weeks. The discrepancy between the announced "one year" duration and the shorter statutory period of roughly two months may reflect political messaging versus legislative caution, or plans for regular Parliamentary review.

## Origins of the "six weeks" confusion

The "six weeks" claim likely stems from three distinct sources that have been conflated over time. First, Prime Minister William Pitt reportedly declared in late February 1797 that "the restriction was only a precautionary government measure, which **in a few weeks would be removed**"—a statement explicitly characterized in an 1867 *North American Review* article as "a legal fiction" designed to prevent panic. Critically, Pitt said "a few weeks," not "six weeks" specifically, and this was political rhetoric on February 27, 1797, before Parliament formalized any duration.

Second, the actual statutory period from May 3 to June 24, 1797 equals approximately 7-8 weeks, which subsequent writers may have rounded to "six weeks" without consulting primary sources. Third, and most importantly, **the Act was amended in 1803** (43 Geo. 3. c. 18) to extend restrictions "until 6 weeks after the start of the next session of parliament"—but this 1803 provision occurred six years after the original Act and has been mistakenly projected backward by some accounts.

## What contemporary sources actually show

Extensive searches of digitized Parliamentary records, contemporary newspapers including *The Times* and *Gentleman's Magazine*, and scholarly analyses reveal no contemporary document explicitly stating "six weeks" as the expected duration in February-March 1797. Instead, multiple sources emphasize that the suspension was presented as **explicitly temporary** to maintain public confidence. The Bank Restriction Act codified the suspension "for a limited period" with what Mark Crosby describes as a "strict time frame" that "bolstered public confidence in Bank of England notes by indicating that they would be redeemable for specie payments at a designated point in the foreseeable future."

The temporary nature proved crucial to the policy's success. On Monday, February 27, 1797—the day after the Privy Council ordered suspension—hundreds of leading London merchants publicly declared they would continue accepting Bank of England notes in payment. This merchant confidence reflected belief in eventual resumption, though contemporary sources consistently describe durations in terms of the parliamentary session, treaty of peace, or vague temporariness rather than specific week counts.

## Timeline of legislative reality

The suspension occurred in stages with evolving timeframes. The Privy Council ordered suspension on February 26, 1797, following news of a French landing in Wales. Parliament passed the Bank Restriction Act (37 Geo. 3. c. 45) on May 3, 1797, initially limiting the restriction until June 24, 1797. Before this first expiration, Parliament extended the Act by 37 Geo. 3. c. 91 until one month after the next parliamentary session commenced. A second 1797 amendment (38 Geo. 3. c. 1) further extended suspension "until one month after the conclusion of the present war by definitive treaty." The restriction ultimately continued through successive annual renewals until 1821—24 years total—despite being consistently characterized as temporary.

Notably, as early as October 1797, the Bank of England wished to resume specie payments as its reserves had recovered, but Prime Minister Pitt prevented this. The Bank's directors repeatedly demonstrated independence from government control, contradicting interpretations that they simply followed ministerial orders regarding note issuance.

## Scholarly consensus and gaps

Leading monetary historians including John Clapham, Albert Feavearyear, and contemporary scholars like O'Brien and Palma consistently omit any mention of "six weeks" as an originally expected duration. Clapham's definitive two-volume history *The Bank of England* (1944-1945), based on unprecedented access to Bank archives and Parliamentary papers, discusses the suspension's temporary nature extensively but never references a six-week expectation. The absence of this detail from the most thorough scholarly treatments is itself significant evidence against the claim.

Recent quantitative analyses further illuminate the context. O'Brien and Palma demonstrate through econometric structural break tests that 1797 marks a clear historical discontinuity in the ratio of Bank of England notes to coin supply, with the distribution shifting from stationarity to a persistent upward trend that continued even after 1821 convertibility restoration. This suggests contemporaries may have understood—despite official temporary framing—that the policy represented a fundamental monetary regime shift.

## For academic citation

To answer your [VERIFY] tag definitively: The "six weeks" claim should be corrected in your manuscript. The most academically rigorous statement, properly cited, would be:

**Recommended text:** "The Bank Restriction Act suspension was initially announced to last one year, though the statutory text of the Act passed May 3, 1797 specified an initial expiration date of June 24, 1797—approximately seven to eight weeks from passage. The restriction was subsequently extended before this first deadline and ultimately continued until 1821 through successive renewals."

## Conclusion: Removing uncertainty with confidence

Based on comprehensive research across primary Parliamentary records, contemporary newspapers, Bank of England archival materials accessed through secondary scholarship, and the most authoritative modern analyses, **no credible evidence supports the "six weeks" claim**. The research instead confirms an initially announced duration of **one year**, with a statutory period of approximately **seven to eight weeks** to the first expiration date. You may confidently remove the [VERIFY] tag and replace the "six weeks" reference with the accurately documented "one year" announcement or the "June 24, 1797" statutory expiration date (seven to eight weeks), properly cited to O'Brien and Palma (2020) and the 1819 Parliamentary report.
