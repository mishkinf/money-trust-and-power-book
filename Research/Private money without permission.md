# Private money without permission: English country banks 1700-1844

English country banks created their own currency through emergent practice that no law explicitly authorized. The 1708 Bank of England Act worked by restricting large partnerships from banking rather than granting small ones permission to issue notes, leaving hundreds of merchant-bankers free to print money without government approval, licenses, or regulatory oversight until Parliament moved to end the system in 1844. This was spontaneous monetary emergence operating in legal gray area—commercial freedom by default rather than state-authorized private money creation.

The distinction matters profoundly. When Thomas Fox, a wool manufacturer in Wellington, Somerset, began issuing his own banknotes in October 1787, he didn't apply for permission, obtain a charter, or register with authorities. He simply designed notes, hired a printer, and started circulating promises to pay that his community accepted as money. This pattern repeated across England as over 800 country banks emerged by 1810 without ever seeking or receiving explicit legal authorization. They operated under common law commercial freedom where what wasn't prohibited was permitted, not under statutory frameworks granting positive rights to create currency. Parliament tolerated this proliferation as an unintended consequence of monopoly protections for the Bank of England, eventually intervening only after banking crises exposed systemic instability.

## The 1708 Act created rights through prohibition, not permission

The Bank of England Act of 1708 (7 Anne c. 30) prohibited partnerships of more than six persons from engaging in banking business. Contemporary understanding and modern scholarship agree this was designed solely to protect the Bank of England's monopoly on joint-stock banking during the War of Spanish Succession, not to authorize smaller banks. The Act contained no clause stating partnerships of six or fewer "may issue bank notes." It worked entirely through restriction—what scholars call a "prohibition-based" rather than "authorization-based" framework.

This legal architecture operated through negative definition. The 1697 Continuance Act had stated "no other Bank or Constitution in the nature of a bank be erected or established, permitted or allowed by Act of Parliament," applying only to corporate bodies requiring parliamentary incorporation. The 1708 Act extended this by prohibiting large partnerships, creating a monopoly by exclusion rather than positive grant. Lord Mansfield's interpretation in Miller v. Race (1758) established bank notes as negotiable instruments equivalent to currency, but never addressed whether issuing them required statutory authorization—the question simply didn't arise because no law claimed to regulate the practice for small partnerships.

Parliamentary debates from 1836 confirm the Act's purpose was explicitly "to confer on the Bank of England a monopoly of the power of issuing notes," with the six-partner restriction serving as the mechanism. One parliamentarian observed that the Bank's charter renewal in 1708 "exempted the Bank from a law that limited note issue to partnerships of no more than six people"—note the phrasing reveals the law limited *others* rather than authorizing the Bank. The monopoly existed only for joint-stock organization. Small partnerships operated in the regulatory void this created, issuing notes under general commercial law principles that treated promissory notes as enforceable contracts requiring no special permission.

The common law framework of 18th-century England presumed commercial liberty. Banking and note issuance were understood as ordinary commercial activities requiring no parliamentary authorization unless they involved incorporation, monopoly privileges, or activities Parliament specifically restricted. Partnerships could engage in any lawful business. Since no statute prohibited small partnerships from issuing promissory notes (which circulated as currency), and since promissory notes were legal commercial instruments under the 1704 Promissory Notes Act, the practice emerged organically. The legal logic was libertarian by default: if Parliament wanted to prohibit an activity, it would say so explicitly.

## Country banks formed spontaneously without any government approval process

The process of starting a country bank before 1826 required zero interaction with government. No licenses existed. No charters were needed. No regulatory body approved applications. No minimum capital requirements were imposed by law. No registration system existed. Founders simply accumulated capital from existing businesses, formed partnerships (keeping partners to six or fewer), designed and printed notes, and began accepting deposits and making loans. The entire process was private, unregulated, and based solely on commercial reputation.

Concrete examples illustrate this remarkable freedom. Thomas Smith of Nottingham operated England's first provincial bank from the 1650s, evolving his cloth merchant business into banking by issuing receipts that circulated as currency. When his descendant Abel Smith II expanded the family's banking network in the mid-1700s, establishing Smith & Payne in London (1758), Smith, Ellison & Co. in Lincoln (1775), and banks in Hull (1784) and Derby (1806), no government permissions were sought or granted. The Lincoln bank started with £3,000 capital that partners pooled themselves, quickly increasing to £21,000. No law specified minimum capital. No official verified the adequacy of reserves. The bank simply began operations.

Thomas Fox's Wellington bank in 1787 demonstrates the typical founding process. Fox ran the Tonedale Mill woolen manufactory and found transporting cash to Exeter dangerous and inconvenient for paying sheep farmers. His father-in-law, a London banker, advised establishing a local bank. Fox accumulated capital from his textile business, designed notes promising to pay bearers on demand, hired printers to produce them, and issued the first notes in October 1787. No government approval preceded or followed this. The bank's credibility derived entirely from Fox's fifty-year reputation as a successful wool manufacturer and from the wealthy partners whose unlimited personal liability backed the notes.

What gave these spontaneous banks credibility without regulatory oversight? **Unlimited personal liability** meant partners risked their entire fortunes if the bank failed, aligning private incentives with public confidence. **Existing business reputations** provided crucial trust—communities accepted notes from established merchants they'd traded with for decades. **Local knowledge** allowed banks to assess creditworthiness better than distant institutions could. **Correspondent relationships** with London goldsmith-bankers provided clearing networks and oversight. **Convertibility promises** meant notes could be redeemed for gold or silver on demand (until the 1797 Bank Restriction Act suspended convertibility during the Napoleonic Wars). Market discipline operated through immediate mechanisms: notes from suspect banks traded at discounts, and bank runs destroyed institutions that lost confidence.

This system exploded during industrialization. By 1784, over 100 country banks operated. By 1793, over 300. By 1810, over 700. By 1815, a country bank existed within fifteen miles of anywhere in England. They proliferated particularly in industrial regions—Lancashire's cotton mills, Yorkshire's wool production, Birmingham's metalworking workshops—because these areas desperately needed local credit and small-denomination notes for wage payments that London banks wouldn't provide. **The Industrial Revolution might have been strangled by lack of capital** without this spontaneous banking emergence, according to economic historians. Yet Parliament never authorized this proliferation. It emerged organically to meet market demand in legal space Parliament had left unregulated.

## Parliament tolerated an unintended consequence, then tried to eliminate it

The 1708 Act's six-partner restriction was not intended to permit smaller banks. It was designed solely to prevent competition with the Bank of England's joint-stock structure. Small bank proliferation was an **unintended consequence** that caught Parliament by surprise. For over a century (1708-1825), Parliament conducted no debates about country banks, imposed no regulations, and created no supervisory framework. These institutions operated without parliamentary acknowledgment or authorization. They weren't legitimate institutions Parliament meant to foster; they were accidents of poorly designed monopoly legislation.

The Panic of 1825 forced recognition. Fifty-nine country banks failed between October 1825 and February 1826, creating financial crisis. Parliamentary debates reveal attitudes: country banks were viewed as sources of instability, their small size and fragility causing "reckless speculation" and "miserable" losses to creditors. The Chancellor acknowledged in February 1826 that the 1708 law's partnership restriction had "greatly enhanced the difficulty of forming solid establishments," implying the original Act never intended to create a stable banking system—it merely protected the Bank of England's monopoly.

The Country Bankers Act 1826 represented Parliament's first substantive engagement with country banking. It permitted joint-stock banks with more than six partners to issue notes outside a 65-mile radius of London, attempting to create larger, more stable institutions. The parliamentary debates show politicians were "resistant and even openly hostile towards the introduction of joint-stock banking" yet felt crisis demanded reform. This was problem-solving, not recognition of legitimate rights. Policy-makers intended to "curb the country banks' ability to expand and contract the supply of money" while the financial press portrayed private banks as "innocent victims" of the Bank of England's monopoly structure.

From 1826 onward, Parliament moved incrementally toward centralizing note issuance. The 1833 Bank Act made Bank of England notes over £5 legal tender and allowed joint-stock deposit banks in London if they gave up note-issuing rights. Multiple parliamentary inquiries examined banking failures—committees met in 1810, 1826, 1832, 1836, and 1840—consistently expressing concern about over-issuance, lack of coordination, and need for centralized control. **These were not debates about whether to authorize country banks. They were debates about how to restrict or eliminate them.**

Sir Robert Peel's 1844 Bank Charter Act definitively ended the spontaneous system. It prohibited establishing new note-issuing banks, froze existing country banks at their 1844 circulation levels, and eliminated note-issuing rights when banks merged. Peel's parliamentary speech on May 6, 1844 referenced "the reckless speculation of some of the Joint Stock Banks, the losses entailed on their shareholders, the insolvency of so many private banks, the miserable amount of the dividends which have in many cases been paid, the ruin inflicted on innocent creditors." He asked members to ignore "pressure should be applied to them by country bankers who feared curtailment of their existing privileges." An 1857 parliamentary debate revealed that "Sir Robert Peel never considered the Act a final measure" and "His ultimate object was that there should be only one bank of issue."

This trajectory—from passive ignorance (1708-1797), through growing awareness (1797-1825), to crisis-driven recognition (1826), to intentional restriction (1833-1844)—demonstrates that Parliament never viewed country banks as institutions deserving authorization or protection. They were vestiges of a flawed system to be gradually eliminated. Fox, Fowler & Company issued the last private English banknote in 1921 when absorbed by Lloyds, ending a system Parliament had accidentally created 213 years earlier.

## The law imposed no reserve ratios, capital requirements, or operational standards before 1844

Research definitively establishes that **no formal reserve requirements existed for country banks before 1844**. No statutory reserve ratios. No minimum reserve levels. No gold backing mandates. No capital adequacy rules. No licensing standards. No registration requirements (until 1826 for joint-stock banks only). No prudential regulation. No government supervision. The system operated without any regulatory infrastructure that modern banking takes for granted.

Banks maintained reserves entirely at their discretion. Voluntary practices varied widely—some banks held substantial gold reserves and maintained conservative lending, while others issued notes far exceeding their specie holdings. No regulatory body monitored these choices or intervened. The only discipline came from market forces: notes from over-extended banks traded at discounts, customers withdrew deposits when worried, and bank runs destroyed institutions that lost confidence. **Unlimited personal liability of partners** provided the sole formal protection—if the bank failed, creditors could pursue partners' personal estates until debts were satisfied.

The Bank Charter Act 1844 represented the first attempt to impose structural requirements, and even it focused narrowly on note issuance rather than comprehensive regulation. It required the Bank of England to hold gold equal to notes issued above £14 million, effectively adopting the Currency School's principle that notes should be 100% backed by specie beyond a fixed fiduciary issue. But the Act imposed no reserve requirements on country banks' existing operations, no capital adequacy standards, no operational rules. It simply froze and gradually eliminated private note issuance without regulating the banking operations themselves. Modern reserve requirements didn't emerge until after World War II—the first formal liquidity reserve ratio of 32% was imposed in 1947, over a century after country banks' heyday.

This regulatory void extended to enforcement mechanisms. No banking regulator existed. No government agency supervised operations. The only criminal enforcement addressed forgery (a capital crime until 1836) and fraud, not regulatory violations. Henry Fauntleroy, a banker who forged securities in 1824, was hanged—but for forgery, not for imprudent banking practices. The Panic of 1825 destroyed over seventy banks yet generated no criminal prosecutions for the failures themselves; honest failure was distinguished from fraud. Market discipline, not legal enforcement, provided primary regulation. When Overend Gurney, a major discount house, failed in 1866, no prosecutions followed despite massive losses—the Bank of England simply adopted its lender-of-last-resort role more fully.

## Case law established notes as negotiable but never clarified the right to issue them

Miller v. Race (1758) stands as the foundational judicial precedent, establishing that bank notes were "as much money, as guineas themselves are" and introducing the holder-in-due-course doctrine that an innocent purchaser for value obtains good title even if the note was stolen. This was crucial for notes to function as currency—they had to pass from hand to hand without bearers investigating prior ownership. Lord Mansfield's decision confirmed notes were negotiable instruments under the 1704 Promissory Notes Act, meaning they could be transferred by delivery or endorsement and the new holder took free of prior claims.

But Miller v. Race addressed notes' **legal status once issued**, not the **right to issue them**. No reported cases between 1700-1844 challenged whether country banks had authority to issue notes. This absence is telling. Either the right was so clearly understood (operating under commercial freedom) that it generated no litigation, or it existed in such legal ambiguity that no one knew how to challenge it, or failed banks lacked assets making litigation pointless. The research reveals remarkably few cases about fundamental banking rights—most disputes settled extra-judicially or through bankruptcy proceedings operating under general partnership law.

The judicial void extended to bank failures. When banks collapsed, courts treated them as ordinary partnership insolvencies, not as special banking cases requiring unique procedures. Partners faced personal liability claims under unlimited liability doctrine. Creditors pursued partners' estates. No special priority system existed for note holders versus depositors. No precedents established standards of care for prudent banking—liability was strict for contractual obligations (redeeming notes) and criminal for intentional fraud, but no "negligence" standard for banking operations emerged during this period. The concept of banking as requiring special legal treatment only developed gradually through the 19th century.

Forgery cases dominated the criminal docket. Old Bailey records from 1766-1800 show multiple prosecutions for forging Bank of England annuities or notes, often carrying death sentences. Sophia Pringle became the first convicted female forger in England in 1787, hanged for forging letters-of-attorney to steal £250 worth of Bank of England annuities. The Bidwell Brothers defrauded the Bank of England of £102,217 in 1873 through forged bills of exchange, receiving life imprisonment. But these cases prosecuted fraud and forgery, not unauthorized banking. No cases established that operating a country bank required parliamentary authorization or that issuing notes without permission was illegal—because no such legal framework existed.

## English spontaneous emergence contrasted sharply with American explicit authorization

US Free Banking Era laws (1837-1863) represented fundamentally different legal architecture. Michigan's 1837 law and New York's 1838 law created **explicit statutory authorization frameworks** requiring banks to deposit state bonds with state auditors backing note issuance, maintain specific capital levels, hold fractional reserves in gold and silver, register with state banking authorities, submit regular reports, and face state-initiated closure if they violated requirements. Anyone meeting these conditions could establish a bank under general incorporation laws—"free entry" replacing individual legislative charters—but the system remained heavily regulated.

The term "free banking" was actually a misnomer. It meant freedom from requiring individual legislative charters (which had been corrupt and politicized, as President Jackson's "pet banks" scandal demonstrated), not freedom from regulation. New York's law explicitly required "(a) all notes the bank issued had to be backed by state bonds deposited at the state auditor's office and (b) all notes had to be redeemable on demand at par." Thus **free banking meant free entry into banking; it did not mean laissez-faire banking**. Eighteen states adopted similar frameworks by 1860, all involving formal compliance with state statutes, regulatory supervision by state banking authorities, and enforcement mechanisms allowing governments to close banks and sell bonds to repay note holders.

Performance varied dramatically by state. New York's system proved relatively successful—banks averaged eight years survival, note losses around 3%, notes traded at 99% of face value. Michigan's version failed disastrously, accepting dubious mortgage-backed bonds and producing note losses of 30-60% of value. But in all cases, banks operated under positive statutory authorization—the law explicitly said "you CAN operate a bank IF you comply with these requirements." This represented state-authorized private money creation from inception, with regulatory framework preceding practice.

English country banking followed the opposite pattern. Banks emerged first, regulation came later (and incompletely). No authorization framework existed. No state supervision. No bond backing requirements. No formal capital mandates. No registration until 1826 (and then only for new joint-stock banks). The legal basis was **negative**—absence of prohibition rather than presence of permission. This was commercial freedom by default under common law where activities were presumptively lawful unless Parliament restricted them.

Scotland's system most closely resembled England's but operated even more freely. From 1792-1845, Scotland had no central bank, allowed completely unrestricted competition in note issuance, and imposed almost no regulations on banking firms. Yet the Scottish system was "thought to be superior by nearly everyone who was aware of it," according to George Selgin's research. Few bank failures occurred despite lack of regulation. Banks maintained high capital ratios (30% of liabilities) providing confidence, with reserve ratios as low as 1-2% of deposits. Modern free banking theorists cite Scotland as premier example of successful competitive currency. The system ended only when the 1845 Bank Notes (Scotland) Act extended Peel's restrictions northward—a political decision, not system failure.

The authorization spectrum ran: **US Free Banking (explicit state authorization with regulatory requirements) → English country banking (emergent within constraints) → Scottish free banking (genuinely unregulated competition)**. England occupied middle ground—more constrained than Scotland's laissez-faire success but less regulated than America's statutory frameworks. The 1708 Act's partnership restriction and Bank of England monopoly protections created boundaries within which spontaneous emergence occurred, but no positive authorization existed and no comprehensive regulation developed until 1844.

## The legal status: spontaneous emergence in gray area, not authorized creation

The definitive answer to whether country bank note issuance was emergent practice that Parliament tolerated versus explicit legal authorization is unambiguous: **it was emergent practice operating in legal gray area**. Every angle of analysis—statutory text, historical formation processes, parliamentary intent, case law, comparative systems, scholarly consensus—points to the same conclusion. No authorization process existed for private banking partnerships. No statute granted permission to issue notes. No common law precedent established a positive right to create currency. The system emerged spontaneously because nothing prohibited it, not because anything authorized it.

This distinction between negative freedom (absence of prohibition) and positive authorization (explicit permission) captures the fundamental nature of English country banking. In legal systems operating on common law principles, commercial activities were presumptively lawful unless Parliament or courts restricted them. Banking and note issuance were commercial activities. The 1708 Act prohibited one form (large partnerships) while leaving another (small partnerships) untouched. Small partnerships could issue notes under general commercial law treating promissory notes as enforceable contracts. No separate authorization was needed or provided.

The proliferation of over 800 banks by 1810 was an **unintended consequence** that caught Parliament unprepared. Parliamentary debates from 1826 onward consistently treated country banks as problems to solve, not institutions to authorize or protect. The trajectory moved inexorably toward centralization and restriction, culminating in the 1844 Bank Charter Act designed to gradually eliminate private note issuance entirely. If country banks had been explicitly authorized, Parliament would have debated withdrawing that authorization. Instead, Parliament simply regulated and restricted what had emerged spontaneously in regulatory void.

The system functioned despite—or perhaps because of—profound legal uncertainty about fundamental rights and obligations. Market discipline operated powerfully when no regulatory safety net existed. Unlimited personal liability aligned private incentives with public confidence. Reputation and local knowledge substituted for regulatory oversight. The system financed the Industrial Revolution by providing local credit and circulating currency where Bank of England notes didn't reach. Yet it operated without clear legal foundation, in gray area between commercial freedom and monetary sovereignty, until Parliament moved decisively to end what it had accidentally created through incomplete monopoly protections for the Bank of England 136 years earlier.

This was spontaneous monetary emergence—private institutions creating money without explicit government authorization, operating in legal space not yet comprehensively regulated, developing through custom and market acceptance rather than statutory design. It represents a historical example fundamentally different from state-authorized private money creation, demonstrating that private currency can emerge and function without explicit legal permission when common law commercial freedom provides the foundation and statutory restrictions leave space for innovation.
