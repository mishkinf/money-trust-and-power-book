Early Credit Systems: Temples and Tallies
Long before coins and banks, credit was recorded by trusted institutions. In ancient Mesopotamia,
temples and palaces acted as bankers: they stored grain and goods and kept detailed clay‐tablet ledgers of
each person’s deposits and debts 1
. In effect, value was measured in weights of grain or silver, and debts
written on cuneiform tablets worked “like ledgers, a recording of what each person had given (credits) and
what they owed (debts)” 1
. These records created a shared unit of account long before coinage, showing
that money is fundamentally about trust and bookkeeping even in the very earliest states. Similarly, in
medieval England the Treasury used split tally sticks – notched wooden sticks – to record tax payments and
loans. From around 1100 A.D., Henry I had sheriffs’ tax receipts inscribed on tallies: each stick was split so
that debtor and creditor each held one matching piece 2
. As historian Samuel Mitchell Innes noted,
“practically the entire business of the English Exchequer consisted in the issuing and receiving of tallies.” In
effect, these notched sticks were state-issued debt instruments carrying “positive value” (the creditor’s
claim) and an equal “negative amount” for the debtor 2
. This dual‐part tally system – a legacy of ancient
social technology – underpinned medieval finance long before coins became universal.
Medieval and Renaissance Trade: Bills of Exchange
and Merchant Banks
As long‐distance trade expanded in the late medieval period, merchant bankers invented new credit
instruments. Italian trading houses in cities like Florence, Venice and Genoa funded commerce across
Europe with bills of exchange – essentially letters directing payment to a correspondent in another city.
One study explains that 13th-century merchants “with correspondents in major European trading centres”
used early bills as certificates of private credit 3
. A Florentine exporter might draw a bill on an associate in
Paris, which could be sold to raise cash; at maturity a Paris banker would pay the specified sum 3
. These
bills let merchants settle complex trades without carrying gold over mountains. Over time, legal changes in
Antwerp and Amsterdam made bills transferable between parties, turning them into active financial
instruments.
By the 18th–20th centuries, this trade finance coalesced around London. Under Britain’s global reach, a
“large discount market for bills of exchange emerged in London” 4
. Domestic and foreign traders would
draw bills on London (often sterling-denominated) and sell them on the City market for immediate funds
4
. In effect, London and its merchant banks became the world’s clearing hub: exporters in one country
could rely on London’s financial markets to guarantee payment, while surplus capital flowed into London’s
banks. This network of merchant credit and exchange anchored the first age of globalization, long before
modern electronic payments.

The Glorious Revolution and Britain’s Financial
Revolution
A decisive break came in the late 17th century when political power in England shifted from the Crown
to Parliament, transforming public finance. The 1688 Glorious Revolution ousted James II and installed
William III, who had to accept that “the laws of England and the liberties of English subjects” were defined
by Parliament – not absolute royal prerogative (as the Bill of Rights 1689 affirmed). Out of the upheaval
emerged a new constitutional monarchy in which the king needed Parliamentary consent for money.
Almost immediately, England declared war on France (1689), triggering a 25‑year conflict (the Nine Years’
War) that would cost some £5–8 million annually 5
. Crucially, the Commons kept William underfunded by
delaying supply bills; as one historian notes, Parliament “deliberately kept William III underfunded, ensuring
that he… had to keep Parliament almost continuously in session to get the money necessary to run a
5
war” .
Parliamentary control of revenue quickly took root. In 1690 the Commons created a Commission of Public
Accounts to oversee wartime spending and began inserting precise appropriations into supply bills 6
. In
practice, this meant taxes could only be raised or redirected by legislation – a radical check on the Crown.
New taxes (on land, hearths, windows, etc.) were introduced, and, because they were enacted by
Parliament, the public regarded them as legitimate despite the burden 7
. Over time these changes
became known as England’s Financial Revolution. By 1698 Parliament passed the first Civil List, granting the
8
Crown a fixed annual revenue and making government spending fully dependent on Parliament .
This new framework built credit by design. In 1694, amid war in Europe, the government chartered the
Bank of England as a joint-stock lender. Investors in the Bank bought shares and lent money to the
government, secured by Parliament’s newly tight grip on taxation. As the House of Commons website
explains, the Bank’s success was assured “for investors… could be confident that their loans to the
Government would be repaid by parliamentary taxation appropriated for that purpose” 9
. In other words,
bondholders had a direct voice in government budgeting, creating a “credible commitment” that Britain
would not default easily 10
. This credibility let Britain borrow at lower interest rates than rival absolutist
powers. As historian John North and political scientist Barry Weingast argued, under a constitutional system
bondholders’ interests are represented in government, so “the risk of default was low… Britain could borrow
more cheaply (at lower interest rates) than… absolute monarchies (such as the Kingdom of France)” 11
. In
sum, the Glorious Revolution turned war finance into state finance: the monarchy still led wars abroad, but
financial trust was anchored in Parliament’s laws and taxes.
Absolutism vs. Parliamentary Finance: The French
Contrast
By contrast, France in the 17th–18th centuries was an absolute monarchy with no parliamentary check on
royal spending. Successive French kings, especially Louis XIV (1643–1715), fought costly wars to expand
territory. Although these wars made France a dominant power, they left the state perpetually in debt. When
Louis XIV died in 1715, France was in “great financial difficulties” after decades of warfare 12
. His five-year-
old successor Louis XV needed regents, and their finance ministers had to curtail spending, raise taxes, and
2
partially default on debts. The Scottish banker John Law was briefly brought in to print paper money and
stimulate the economy, but his Mississippi Bubble (1720) spectacularly collapsed, wiping out huge swaths of
government debt. France repeatedly restructured or even suspended its debts: in this era, royal debt
holders knew the king could alter contracts by decree.
Such defaults undermined international credit. Foreign lenders learned that they had little recourse if a
Bourbon king chose to repudiate obligations. One economic historian points out that before the French
Revolution the last “drastic” debt reduction was in 1797 – when the revolutionary Convention unilaterally cut
public debt by two-thirds 13
. This history made French borrowing expensive. In practice, creditors
demanded high interest or left capital to London or Amsterdam. Britain’s parliamentarian system, by
contrast, brought “fair treatment of the creditors” and more predictable outcomes 13
. As the Financial
Revolution narrative emphasizes, Britain’s constitutional setup gave bondholders confidence; absolutist
11 12
France’s lack of checks meant its deficits often ended in enforced losses for lenders .
Isaac Newton and the Gold Standard
England’s move toward credit-based money did not eliminate coinage – rather, it fixed it. In 1717 Isaac
Newton, as Master of the Royal Mint, adjusted the gold-to-silver ratio by overvaluing gold. The effect was to
drive silver coins out of circulation and accidentally put Britain on a de facto gold standard 14
. Under this
standard (formalized later), the pound’s value was tied to a fixed quantity of gold. Newton’s adjustment
inadvertently reinforced the Bank of England’s reliability: a stable gold‐anchored currency meant that
government paper and banknotes were backed by a known metal value. As Britain’s financial clout grew,
other nations adopted gold-linked systems. By the late 19th century almost all major economies were on a
gold (or gold‐exchange) standard, setting up a pre‐WWI system of fixed exchange rates.
However, fixed gold parity also meant governments’ fiscal policy was constrained. In normal times this
limited inflation, but in crisis it became untenable. When wars broke out in the Napoleonic era, and again in
World Wars I and II, countries faced a brutal choice: try to defend the gold peg and cripple the economy, or
suspend convertibility to print money and fight on. In World War I, central banks were literally torn
between maintaining the gold standard and funding the war effort 15
. Britain and the United States
initially upheld their gold links, but France, Germany, and Austria-Hungary abandoned gold payments to
finance huge deficits 15
. This global conflict showed that under wartime pressure, even the “pillar of
monetary stability” could fracture. Governments issued vast amounts of notes and debt, promising future
taxation to pay them off, but often at the cost of inflation.
Bretton Woods and the Postwar Order
After WWII, policymakers again sought a stable global system. At the 1944 Bretton Woods conference,
Britain’s Keynes proposed an International Clearing Union with a supranational currency (“bancor”) to
prevent chronic imbalances 16
. The plan would have meant that gold and national currencies no longer
moved in trade 17
. In the end, the United States’ vision prevailed: the new IMF and World Bank fixed
exchange rates so that each currency was pegged to the US dollar, and the dollar itself was convertible to
gold at $35/oz 18
. This “Bretton Woods system” meant nations agreed to maintain their pegs (except in
18
fundamental disequilibrium) and drew on IMF funds to buffer shocks .
3
The system lasted over two decades, funded by the credibility of the US dollar. But domestic and global
pressures – notably US spending on the Vietnam War and large balance-of-payments deficits – eventually
broke it. In August 1971 President Nixon “slammed shut the ‘gold window,’ suspending dollar
convertibility” 19
. With that, the Bretton Woods fixed-rate system collapsed. Within a few years, most
major currencies began floating, and gold ceased to underpin day-to-day exchange rates.
Fiat Money, Central Banks, and Modern Lessons
Since 1971 we have lived in a world of fiat currency – money with no intrinsic commodity backing – making
trust and institutions ever more critical. Unlike past eras where gold or elaborate clearing unions
provided anchors, today’s money relies on the credibility of central banks and governments. Claudio Borio
of the BIS notes that a well-functioning monetary system “requires trust that [money] will deliver price and
financial stability,” and that “ensuring trust…calls for strong institutions – an appropriate ‘institutional
technology.’ Central banks…have evolved to become key pillars of the whole edifice” 20
. Indeed, modern
policy frameworks (inflation targeting, financial regulation, fiscal rules) are explicitly meant to sustain
confidence.
The lessons of history underline this. Just as 17th-century Britain built trust by tying debt to parliamentary
taxes 9
, today countries must show they can honor debts and control inflation. Internationally, the
Bretton Woods collapse taught us that stability comes not from rigid pegs but from cooperation and
sound policies. As an IMF historian reflects, the 1971 collapse “paved the way for the modern international
monetary system,” one no longer based on fixed gold but on policy credibility and coordination 19 21
. In
our digital age, discussions even consider new global currencies or crypto arrangements, but the bedrock
remains unchanged: money works only if users trust it. Governments and banks today aim to preserve that
trust with transparent rules, central bank accountability, and international oversight – the same core insight
that linked the temple scribes of Ur to the parliamentary budgets of London and beyond.
