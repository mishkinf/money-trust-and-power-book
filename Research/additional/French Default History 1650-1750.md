1. French Default History (1650–1750)
France’s crown regularly defaulted or restructured its debt, especially after major wars. In the mid-17th
century Fronde crisis the government suspended payments: for example, in 1648–49 interest on the crown’s
loans was cut off and rolled over (effectively a default) 1 . After this turmoil a royal chambre de justice
(debt court) in 1652 further wrote down obligations. One study notes that the crown “accepted three major
defaults, 1634, 1648 and 1652, with attendant chambres de justice” 1 . Such defaults meant creditors
(often wealthy financiers and tax-farm syndicates) lost substantial claims. For instance, after the 1634
default rentes were converted from 10% to ~4.2% interest 1 . By 1659 the monarchy was paying over 25%
interest on new loans because of its tarnished credit 1 .
After Louis XIV’s wars, debt crises recurred. In 1716 Regent Philippe’s government, following John Law’s
collapse, convened a Chambre de justice to restructure debt 2 . It imposed fines of 219 million livres
(≈£8.8 million) on office-holders and cut interest on short-term debt

2

. Nonetheless the crown’s total

liabilities still soared: by 1720 France owed ~2.2 billion livres (≈£88 million), about 50% of France’s GDP 3
4 . (By comparison, England’s only comparable default was Charles II’s 1672 Stop-of-Exchequer, which
suspended ~£1.21 million of debt 1 5 but was soon remedied.)
The immediate effect of defaults was higher borrowing costs. With repeated reneging, France’s lenders
demanded very high rates. In the 1650s France routinely paid 15–25% interest on new loans 1 , while
more-stable states paid only ~4–5% (the Dutch Republic, e.g., borrowed at ~4% in 1650s). This wariness
persisted: by 1680s French annuities often carried 6–7% coupons, whereas Britain’s long-term debt was
nearer 4% 6 5 . In short, each French default forced a risk premium: France’s debt carries averaged 3–4
percentage points higher interest than England’s equivalent.
By contrast, England defaulted far less. Apart from 1672’s Stop-of-Exchequer, post-1690 Britain never
repudiated its perpetual debt. English creditors had confidence that Parliament-bound governments would
honor debt. As one account observes, British monarchs borrowed at roughly 3–4%, whereas “French
monarchs were free to renege on their debts, and often did… [thus] had to offer excessive interest
rates” (about 6% or more) 6 . In effect, French borrowers paid a recurring credibility premium: for every
£100 loaned, France’s extra 3–4% cost meant £3–4 more per year than Britain.
Key Comparison: France defaulted repeatedly (major restructurings in 1648–52 and 1716
), wiping out large debts and forcing interest rates to the teens; England’s only major
default was the 1672 Exchequer stop, after which it resumed payments at ~6% 1 .
Consequently, eighteenth-century France borrowed at ~6–10% interest (depending on year)
versus ~3–5% for Britain 5 6 , implying a 3–5 point “credibility premium” on French debt.

2. Comparative Borrowing Costs (1690–1750)
The interest rates on government loans differed markedly. In late 17th–early 18th c. Britain’s long-term
debt generally yielded about 3–5%. For example, by the 1720s England’s consolidated annuities and Navy

1

Bills carried ~4–5% coupons, reflecting Parliament’s credible commitment 6 7 . By contrast, France’s
yields were roughly double. Contemporary price data show 4% French rentes traded at only ~35% of par in
1718, implying a yield of ~10–11% 5 . Even after debt restructuring, French perpetual annuities still yielded
6–8% through the 1720s 5 . Thus during 1700–1730 France typically paid around 7–10% on long-term
loans, versus 4–5% for Britain. In sum, French borrowing costs were 3–5 points higher (e.g. 10% vs 5%).
Loan examples: French loans typically had low coupons and heavy tax collateral. Under John Law, the crown
issued (for example) perpetual annuities at only 2.5% (June 1720) secured on indirect taxes, and at 2–4%
(August 1720) secured on specified revenues 8 . These low rates were compensated by default risk and tax
backing. In England, comparable government borrowing would have been through the Bank of England
(e.g. in 1690s–1700s Britain issued 4% bonds), or short-term Exchequer bills at ~5–6%. Even King William’s
early 1690s (post-1688) loans cost only 5–6%, well below France’s cost.
After 1688 the Glorious Revolution strengthened British credit: yields gradually fell to ~3–4% by 1700.
France had no similar break; Louis XIV’s wars (1689–1713) kept French rates up around 6–8% at best. For
example, immediately after 1690 the Duke of Berwick noted France’s borrowing had to bear 8–10% coupons
to attract lenders (collected abroad or via bankers). In Britain, by contrast, the new regime’s stability let it
refinance at ~4–5%.
To quantify the credibility premium, consider this illustration: if France borrowed £10 million at 8% while
Britain borrowed the same at 5%, the extra 3% cost is £0.3 million per year. On the scale of early-18th-c.
revenues (Britain’s ~£5–8 m, France’s ~£7–10 m annual receipts), each percentage point difference was a
very large fiscal burden. In modern terms, France paid roughly 50–60% more in interest on its debt than
Britain 5 6 , purely due to weaker credibility.
Key Comparison: In the same period, Britain’s government bonds yielded around 4–5%,
whereas France’s carried about 7–11% 5 6 . For example, 1718 French 4% rentes yielded
~11% (price 35%) 5 , versus ~5% in England. This 3–6 point gap (roughly +3–4 percentage
points premium) meant France paid far more annual interest (on a £100m debt, ~£3–6m
extra) than Britain 5 6 . (In local currency: e.g. France’s 1718 loan at 10% vs England at 5%
means 60m livres extra per year – on an economy of ~4.4 bn livres GDP.)

3. French Tax Farming System
Under the Old Regime France outsourced most tax collection. The crown sold multi-year contracts to
fermiers généraux (tax-farm syndicates) to collect indirect taxes (customs, excise, tobacco, salt, etc.) for a
fixed payment 9 10 . Typically a ferme contract lasted 6 years 9 . The fermiers paid the king an upfront
lump-sum plus agreed annuities, then kept all proceeds above that. In practice they gained huge profits:
one study finds individual tax farmers earned annual returns of 15–37% on their capital 11 . For example, an
1762–68 lease generated profits yielding about 37% on the bond paid 11 (meaning the farmers kept ~37%,
so only ~63% of gross taxes went to the treasury). Other contracts show 12–24% returns 11 . In short,
French collectors kept roughly 30–40% of nominal tax receipts as profit or graft, leaving only ~60–70%
reaching the king.
Tax-farming bred corruption and waste. Farmers imposed heavy surcharges on ordinary people and bribed
officials. Administrative overheads were high: for instance enforcing the infamous Gabelle (salt tax) required

2

armed patrols to combat smuggling, costing an estimated 10–15% of the revenue 12 . (By contrast, Britain’s
excise was collected by salaried officers at much lower cost.) Overall, indirect taxes in France “were very
numerous but little productive, mal levés selon le désastreux système de la ferme” (Godechot) 13 . Indeed,
contemporaries noted that the ferme’s profits were regarded as “exactions” on the people, and tax farmers
were despised for “impositions… sur le peuple français.” 14 .
By comparison, England’s tax system was mostly direct and state-collected. British taxes (land tax,
window tax, excise duties on goods, customs tariffs) were levied under parliamentary statutes and collected
by royal officials or local commissioners. For example, the Land Tax Acts of each year named unpaid local
“commissioners” to assess and collect the tax 15 . There was no massive tax-farm; merchant and excise
duties were enforced by government inspectors. Consequently, collection efficiency was higher: British
excise/customs collection costs were only a few percent of revenue, whereas French indirect taxes often lost
over 10% in administration and fraud 12 . In effect, England collected nearly all the taxes it assessed, while
France’s ferme system leaked a large share to intermediaries.
Finally, because tax farmers handled only indirect taxes, the French crown’s revenue base was narrower.
The Ferme Générale by mid-18th c. provided over one-third of all royal revenue 10 – but this was offset by
no consistent direct tax on nobles or clergy. In England, by contrast, Parliament could impose broad taxes
(e.g. land or window tax on property owners 15 ) and enforce customs easily at ports. Thus England tapped
a wider base (all property and trade) without the distortions of farming.
Key Comparison: In France an outsized share of taxes was lost to fermiers généraux. The
Ferme Générale accounted for well over 30% of revenues 10 , yet its contracts returned ~15–
37% to farmers 11 . (Roughly 30–40% of gross tax never reached the king.) In England, by
contrast, the central government collected taxes directly (e.g. land tax via local
commissioners 15 ) and bore most costs itself. As a result British tax collection costs were
very low, and a far higher percentage of assessed tax ended up in the Treasury. In sum,
France’s tax-farm system delivered only ~60–70% of nominal receipts, versus nearly ~90–
100% collected under the British system.

4. Comparative Fiscal Capacity (1690–1750)
Despite its size, France raised a smaller share of its GDP in taxes than Britain. British total tax receipts
averaged roughly 8% of GDP in the 18th century 7 . France’s central government generally realized around
6–8% of GDP. For example, around 1720 the crown’s revenue was ~150–200m livres per year on a GDP
~4.4 billion livres (since total debt ~2.2 bn was 50% GDP 3 4 ). Thus France’s tax/GDP was slightly lower.
Reflecting this, per‑capita tax burdens were much lighter in France: one historian notes that with 19 million
people versus Britain’s 7 million, “France had… a substantially lower average per capita tax burden” despite
comparable per-capita GDP 16 .
Collection efficiency also differed. In Britain, national taxes (customs, excise, land tax) were routinely and
broadly enforced. Smuggling was a problem, but administrative costs were held at a few percent of yield. By
contrast, French tax farming and local exemptions meant much “leakage.” As noted, surveys of 1770s tax
farms show operational costs (including graft) of order 10–15% 12 . Thus a given nominal tax generated
more revenue net of costs in England than in France.

3

Finally, the legal power to tax differed. England’s Parliament, after 1688, could impose any new tax across all
classes. Long-term wartime fiscal policy created an increasingly diverse toolkit of levies (land, stamp,
window, etc.), enforced by state agents. France’s Estates system, by contrast, confined the king’s direct taxes
mostly to peasants: nobles and clergy were exempt (e.g. taille applied only to commoners). Provincial
parlements often refused royal tax edicts. In effect, French rulers had fewer effective levers: customs and
excises via the ferme were all they could reliably expand. This narrower base meant even 6–8% of GDP
required onerous burdens on those few who paid.
Key Comparison: By 1700–50 Britain routinely collected on the order of 8–10% of GDP in
taxes 7 , whereas France managed closer to 6–8%. With only ~7 million people, Britain could
raise more per capita than France’s 19 million 16 . Moreover, Britain’s tax system was far less
“leaky”: English taxes faced only ~3–5% collection costs, while French indirect taxes lost ~10–
15% to farming overhead 12 . Thus for a given GDP the British crown captured a larger net
revenue.

5. Why France Failed to Copy England (Pre-1800)
France lacked England’s institutional prerequisites for a stable financial system. After 1688 England
developed constitutional checks: Parliament approved budgets and taxes, and powerful commercial
interests (the Whig–City alliance) ensured public debt was honored. France had no analog. The French king
rarely convened representative estates, and parlements (high courts) could veto tax laws. There was never a
stable power-sharing arrangement that bound the monarchy to creditors. As one analyst notes, Britain’s
credit regime depended on “the credible commitment of a dominant party (the Whigs) stabilizing policy,”
whereas “France’s government lacked any similar party coalition” 17 18 .
In concrete terms, no French “Bank” succeeded before Napoleon because there was no trusted
intermediary or political backing. John Law’s Banque Générale (1716) was the closest attempt, but it failed
due to over-speculation and lack of checks. Contemporary critics pointed out that England’s Bank of
England enjoyed Whig support and the security of Parliament, whereas France’s Banque Royale had no
entrenched support group 17 . After Law’s Mississippi Bubble burst in 1720, the word “bank” became so
discredited that France avoided central banking for decades 19 . By contrast, the Bank of England (founded
1694) survived because Parliament obliged the Crown to service it, and it operated under a legal monopoly
backed by the government.
Constitutional barriers also mattered. French parlements jealously guarded privileges and could veto new
taxes, making stable revenue streams unpredictable. There was no body like the British Parliament to insist
on full taxation of all estates. The ancien régime aristocracy and clergy enjoyed exemptions, and any
attempt to mimic England’s excise reforms was thwarted by entrenched interests (as in the 1690s exchequer
crisis). Without predictable revenue, French kings feared creating irredeemable debt or a banking institution
that might challenge royal prerogative.
It was only the Radical break of 1789–1800 that changed this. The Revolution abolished feudal and fiscal
privileges, unifying France’s tax base. Under Napoleon, a strong central state imposed uniform taxes and
repaid or stabilized debt. In 1800 Napoléon chartered the Banque de France 20 to regulate currency and
credit. Crucially, this new bank had both state backing and a narrow charter (initially issuing notes in
Paris only), avoiding the mistakes of Law’s bank. Napoleon also created the Franc germinal (gold coin) in

4

1803, anchoring the monetary system. These changes – an empowered central government, abolition of
estate exemptions, and a clear legal framework for the bank – finally gave France the institutional basis that
England had enjoyed since 1690.
Key Comparison: England’s Bank of England (1694) operated under an act of Parliament and
was effectively guaranteed by the new constitutional order. France’s first bank (Law’s Banque
Générale, 1716) had no such backing and collapsed in 1720 19 . Scholars emphasize that
Britain’s finance was sustained by a political coalition (Whigs + creditors) 17 , whereas
France lacked any credible check on the monarchy. Consequently, France could not match
England’s financial revolution until after 1800, when Napoléon’s government centralized
authority and established Banque de France 20 .
