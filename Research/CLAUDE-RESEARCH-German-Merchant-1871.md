# Research Request: German Merchant/Businessman During 1871-1873 Monetary Transition

## OBJECTIVE

Locate a **documented individual** (merchant, businessman, banker, or commercial figure) who experienced Germany's transition from silver thaler to gold-backed Reichsmark during the 1871-1873 period. This individual will serve as a human-interest vignette for Chapter 6 of *Money, Trust, and Power*.

**Research Goal:** Find a real person with verifiable primary source documentation showing their experience of the monetary transition—NOT a composite or fictional character.

## DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS

### Minimum Acceptable Documentation:

**For a named individual, you must establish:**
1. **Real name** (first and last name)
2. **Specific location** (city, ideally address or district)
3. **Business type** (merchant in [commodity], banker, manufacturer, etc.)
4. **Date range** (documented activity 1871-1873)
5. **Primary source citation** (where this information comes from)

**Example of minimally acceptable finding:**

> **Friedrich Wilhelm Schröder** (1832-1889), textile merchant in Hamburg's Kontorhaus district. Schröder's firm, established 1858, traded British woolens imported through Hull against German grain exports. In testimony before the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce (Handelskammer) on March 12, 1872, Schröder complained that outstanding contracts denominated in thaler suffered "losses of 10-12 percent" when converted to Reichsmark at the official rate. His firm held £2,400 in British consols (gold-backed) which appreciated relative to silver thaler holdings.

### What We DON'T Need (Skip if Not Available):
- Extensive biography of the person
- Details about their family or personal life (unless relevant to monetary transition)
- Their views on politics unrelated to currency
- Business activities before 1870 or after 1874 (unless brief context)

## EVIDENTIARY GAPS TO ACKNOWLEDGE

If research reveals the following **gaps**, document them honestly:

1. **No named individual found:**
   - Report: "Contemporary records from Hamburg's Handelskammer document merchant complaints about conversion losses in the range of 8-12%, but individual merchants are not named in surviving digitized records."
   - This is acceptable—aggregate data can be used instead

2. **Named but minimal detail:**
   - Report what can be verified, acknowledge limitations
   - Example: "Johann Schmidt is mentioned in Handelskammer minutes but specific losses not quantified"

3. **Conflicting accounts:**
   - Report both, cite sources
   - Note discrepancies

4. **Access limitations:**
   - If sources exist but require in-person archive visits: Document this
   - Example: "The Staatsarchiv Hamburg Bestand 621-1 contains relevant Handelskammer records from 1871-1872, but these are not digitized and require on-site research."

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT (Hypothetical)

### Executive Summary
✅ **Individual Located:** Friedrich Wilhelm Schröder, Hamburg textile merchant

### Individual Profile
**Name:** Friedrich Wilhelm Schröder  
**Dates:** 1832-1889  
**Location:** Hamburg, Kontorhaus district (near the Alster)  
**Business:** Import-export merchant specializing in British woolens and German grain  
**Firm:** Schröder & Sohn, established 1858  

### Monetary Transition Experience
Schröder testified before the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce on March 12, 1872, that his firm experienced currency conversion losses of "10 to 12 percent on outstanding contracts denominated in thaler." His testimony specified:

- Held contracts for £2,400 in British consols (gold-backed bonds) purchased in 1869
- Had receivables worth 45,000 silver thaler from grain sales awaiting collection
- When forced to convert at official rate (3 mark = 1 thaler), the silver-denominated assets had depreciated relative to his gold-backed British holdings
- Estimated total loss at approximately 4,500 marks due to silver devaluation

**Direct Quote:** "Die plötzliche Abwertung des Silbers hat unsere Verträge in Thalern um mehr als zehn Prozent entwertet." ("The sudden devaluation of silver depreciated our contracts in thaler by more than ten percent.")

### Primary Source Documentation

¹ Handelskammer Hamburg, *Protokolle der Plenarsitzungen 1872*, Staatsarchiv Hamburg, Bestand 621-1/14, session of March 12, 1872, pp. 45-47.

² *Hamburger Adressbuch 1870* (Hamburg: Verlag der Handelskammer, 1870), listing Schröder & Sohn at Alsterarkaden 12.

³ Hermann Kellenbenz, *Der Überseehandel Hamburgs im 19. Jahrhundert* (Hamburg: Verein für Hamburgische Geschichte, 1958), 234, citing Schröder firm as representative mid-sized textile merchant.

### Evidentiary Assessment
**High Confidence:**
- Schröder's testimony to Handelskammer (primary source, official minutes)
- Firm's existence and address (Hamburg business directory)
- Approximate loss percentage (Schröder's own testimony)

**Medium Confidence:**
- Specific amounts (£2,400, 45,000 thaler) if cited by Schröder in testimony
- Exact loss calculation depends on which contracts and timing

**Limitations:**
- Personal details about Schröder (dates 1832-1889) come from secondary source (Kellenbenz)
- No surviving Schröder firm records beyond Handelskammer testimony
- Whether firm survived long-term is unclear

## TIME ALLOCATION RECOMMENDATION

**Phase 1 (Digital Search): 2-3 hours**
- Google Books, HathiTrust, JSTOR searches
- Europeana and digital archives
- Contemporary publications search

**Phase 2 (If Leads Found): 1-2 hours**
- Follow up specific citations
- Verify sources
- Build complete documentation

**Phase 3 (Report Writing): 1 hour**
- Compile findings
- Format citations properly
- Assess evidentiary quality

**Total Estimated: 4-6 hours of research time**

---

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

Research will be considered **successful** if it produces:

**Option A (Best):** Named individual with primary source documentation showing currency transition impact

**Option B (Acceptable):** Well-documented firm with archival sources showing currency transition

**Option C (Minimum):** Secondary source with strong case study citing primary sources (e.g., academic article analyzing specific merchant's experience with footnoted archive citations)

Research will be considered **unsuccessful but honest** if it produces:

**Option D:** Clear documentation that digitally accessible sources do not contain named individuals, but identification of which physical archives would need to be visited for primary research

---

## FINAL NOTES

**Priority:** Find a **real person** if possible. Composite characters are acceptable in narrative nonfiction BUT real documented individuals are always stronger for top-tier publication.

**Citation integrity:** Every fact must be citeable. If it's not documented, we can't claim it.

**Accessibility:** Prefer sources that are digitally accessible or clearly documented so that publishers' fact-checkers can verify.

**Honest gaps:** It's acceptable to report "no named individual found" rather than fabricate details. We can work with aggregate data if necessary.

This research will support a 500-word vignette in Chapter 6 that brings the German monetary transition to life through documented human experience.
