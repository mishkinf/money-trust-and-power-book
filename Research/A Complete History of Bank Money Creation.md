# Private Money's Public Foundation: A Complete History of Bank Money Creation, 3000 BCE to 2014

## Introduction: The Paradox of Private Money

**Banks create most of the money we use—but they can only do so because the state lets them.** This is the central paradox that resolves a seeming contradiction in monetary theory: private banks create roughly 90% of the money supply in modern economies through lending, yet this massive private money creation actually proves rather than contradicts the institutional view that state money forms the foundation of all monetary systems. From Mesopotamian temples to modern central banking, the pattern repeats: attempts at purely private money creation without state sanction end in collapse, while successful private banking operates within state-created legal and monetary frameworks.

This report traces 5,000 years of private banking history, with intensive focus on the critical English country banks era (1700-1844) when private note issuance reached its peak, and the deposit banking revolution that followed. The evidence shows that every instance of "free" private money—from English goldsmith receipts (1640-1672) to American wildcat banking (1837-1863)—either required retrospective state legalization or ended catastrophically. The hierarchy of money, with state currency at the apex enforced through taxation and settlement requirements, has shaped banking from ancient Babylon to Bitcoin.

**What's new**: Private money creation reached unprecedented scale in 18th-19th century Britain and America, yet stability required state intervention. **Why it matters**: Current debates over cryptocurrencies, shadow banking, and monetary sovereignty replay this ancient tension between private innovation and public foundation. **The backstory**: The 1844 Bank Charter Act regulated visible banknotes while ignoring invisible deposits—the greatest regulatory failure in banking history, allowing fractional reserve deposit creation to explode unchecked for decades.

## PART I: THE CHRONOLOGICAL NARRATIVE (Ancient Times Through 2014)

### The Ancient Foundation: State-Controlled Credit (3000 BCE - 1500 CE)

Private money creation was virtually nonexistent in the ancient world. **Sumerian temples and palaces (c. 3000 BCE) pioneered accounting-based credit** through cuneiform clay tablets, but Hudson (2018) emphasizes these were fundamentally state-managed institutions: "The origins of monetary debts and means of payment are grounded in the accounting practices innovated by Sumerian temples and palaces." The Code of Ur-Nammu (c. 2100 BCE) legally regulated loans and interest, confirming state control over credit relations.

By the Neo-Babylonian period (600-500 BCE), private merchant families like the House of Egibi emerged, but these were **intermediaries, not money creators**—they charged the same rates for loans as they paid for deposits, merely redistributing existing specie rather than creating new purchasing power. The Knights Templar (1119-1312) developed letters of credit by 1150, facilitating fund transfers across Europe, but these were **transfer instruments, not circulating money**. Despite romantic myths, the Templars did not invent banknotes or checks before Western printing emerged.

**Medieval Italian merchant banks** came closest to private money creation through bills of exchange. The Bardi and Peruzzi families of Florence, employing 300+ workers with branches across Europe, issued bills that began circulating beyond original parties by the 14th century. Puttevils (2015) confirms that by 16th-century Antwerp, bills were "transferable and negotiable financial instruments...considered as part of the money supply." However, these operated within state-sanctioned legal frameworks: London's law-merchant court established bearer rights in 1436, while the Habsburg Netherlands produced "Europe's first national legislation" on bill negotiability in 1537-41, explicitly legalizing interest up to 12%.

The pattern is clear: **no evidence exists of private credit instruments functioning as general-circulation money independent of state authorization before 1640**.

### The English Experiment: Goldsmith Banking and Catastrophic Collapse (1633-1700)

The **first true private money** emerged accidentally in Civil War England. The earliest goldsmith receipt dates to 1633 (Lawrence Hoare), but the system transformed after 1640 when **Charles I seized £200,000 from the Royal Mint**, destroying confidence in government storage. Goldsmiths pivoted from metalworking to finance, accepting deposits and issuing receipts. The revolutionary innovation occurred in the 1640s-50s: receipts became **"payable to bearer"** and circulated throughout London as de facto currency.

By the 1660s, Edward Backwell and other goldsmith-bankers dominated finance, with depositors including Charles II, the future James II, Samuel Pepys, and the East India Company. Most critically, they discovered fractional reserve banking: Faure (2013) notes that "money creation as we know it today...began when the deposit receipts of goldsmith-bankers became accepted by the general public...they could make loans by writing out new receipts (i.e. money)." Reserve ratios varied wildly—Cantillon documented ranges of 10% to 66%—but the goldsmith-bankers were creating money "**out of thin air**."

**Was this authorized?** No. Goldsmith banking emerged in a **legal gray area**—no charters, no statutory authorization, purely emergent based on market trust. This contrasts sharply with the chartered Stockholms Banco (1656) and Amsterdam Wisselbank (1609). English goldsmith receipts represent the only clear historical case of large-scale private money creation without initial state sanction.

**The catastrophe came January 2, 1672**: Charles II's **Stop of the Exchequer** suspended repayment of £1.3 million to fund the Third Anglo-Dutch War. Gilbert Burnet recorded that "the bankers were broken, and multitudes who had put their money in their hands were ruined by this dishonourable and perfidious action." Five major goldsmith banks went bankrupt, nine others were severely undermined, and over 10,000 wealthy families were ruined. Commerce "ground to a halt" (Milevsky 2017).

The Stop proved goldsmith receipts had become true money—otherwise the default wouldn't have caused such catastrophic systemic disruption. It also demonstrated the fatal flaw of unregulated private money: **no crisis resolution mechanism**. Legal battles dragged on until 1700, with only about half of creditors eventually receiving payment. The solution was state intervention: the **Bank of England**, chartered in 1694, ended sovereign defaults and provided a regulated framework. By 1704, Parliament retrospectively legalized private banking practices through the Promissory Notes Act—but the era of truly unauthorized private money had ended.

### Country Banks: The Golden Age of Private Money (1700-1844)

The English country banks era represents **the most extensive experiment in private money creation before modern deposit banking**. Following the Stop's trauma, private banking reemerged gradually outside London, filling credit vacuums in industrializing regions.

**Timeline and origins**: The first provincial bank emerged around 1650 (Thomas Smith, cloth merchant, Nottingham), predating even the Bank of England. But explosive growth came later: from ~100 banks (1784) to 300+ (1793) to a peak of **700-800 banks by 1810-1825**. These were **unchartered partnerships** operating through emergent practice, not statutory authorization. The 1708 Bank of England Act restricted partnerships to six persons maximum for note-issuing banks, keeping country banks small, but didn't authorize them—it merely constrained them.

**Who founded them?** **Thomas Fox exemplifies the pattern**: a wool manufacturer in Wellington, Somerset, Fox established Fox, Fowler & Company in 1787 as a "supplementary chain" to his textile business. Industrialists needed working capital for mills, mines, and factories. Country banks were founded by **wool traders, ironmasters, merchants, and manufacturers**—not traditional bankers but entrepreneurs financing the Industrial Revolution. Fox, Fowler would become the last private bank in England to issue its own notes, merging with Lloyds in 1921 with notes remaining legal until 1964.

**Money creation mechanisms**: Country banks issued their own distinctively designed banknotes when making loans. A Manchester mill owner needing £500 for wool would bring a trade bill worth £520 due in 90 days; the bank discounted it at 5% annual, paying £513.50 in the bank's own notes. These notes circulated locally for wages, retail purchases, and debt repayment. If Fox, Fowler held only £100 in reserves, they had **created £413.50 of new money**. This was **fractional reserve banking** with no statutory reserve requirements—ratios varied by bank from perhaps 5% to 33%.

**What backed the notes?** A mixed portfolio: specie reserves (gold/silver coins), Bank of England notes, commercial bills of exchange, and ultimately the **credit and reputation of the issuer**. Country bank notes typically didn't circulate far from their issuing location—local trust was essential.

**Reserve pyramiding**: Country banks held reserves primarily as deposits with London correspondent banks (e.g., Barclays served as agent for 14 country banks by 1800) and Bank of England notes, not gold. London banks held reserves as Bank of England deposits. The Bank of England held gold. This created an "**inverted pyramid**" where country banks leveraged London deposits, London banks leveraged Bank of England reserves, and the whole structure rested on limited gold holdings.

**Quantitative scale**: By 1810, **banknotes (Bank of England + country banks) represented ~60% of the English money supply**, with coins at ~40%—a dramatic shift from the pre-1797 coin-dominated system. This was unprecedented private money creation. Country bank note circulation reached several tens of millions of pounds, with estimates varying. One study found aggregate banknote circulation around £21 million in 1810, of which country banks contributed substantially.

**Regulation and elimination**: The 1708 Act restricted size but didn't regulate operations. The **1826 Country Bankers Act**, responding to the Panic of 1825, allowed joint-stock banks outside a 65-mile London radius and prohibited notes under £5. The **1844 Bank Charter Act** dealt the death blow: it prohibited new note-issuing banks and capped existing banks' note issue at 1844 levels. By 1844, the Bank of England issued 76% of notes and country banks just 24%. The gradual elimination proceeded over decades: 157 note-issuing banks (1880), 55 (1900), 11 (1914), zero (1921).

**Crisis of 1825-26**: The Panic of 1825 saw **71 country banks fail (10% of all banks)**, triggered by Latin American debt defaults and stock market crashes. This was comparable to the 2007-08 crisis in severity according to Turner (2014). The crisis directly led to the 1826 reforms allowing joint-stock banks and restricting small notes.

**The tragic irony**: While Parliament meticulously regulated visible banknotes, it **completely ignored deposits**—the emerging dominant form of money. This would prove the greatest regulatory failure in banking history.

### The Invisible Revolution: Deposit Banking Ascendant (1844-1914)

The Bank Charter Act 1844 paradoxically **accelerated deposit banking** by strangling note issuance. If banks couldn't profit from notes, they would create deposits instead—and no law constrained this.

**The transition**: Deposits overtook notes as dominant bank money by the **1860s-1870s**. While precise decade-by-decade statistics across all banks are scarce, the evidence is clear: note circulation declined from ~£30 million (1844) to nearly negligible (1914), while deposits exploded. By 1873, when Bagehot published *Lombard Street*, **London deposits alone reached £120 million** compared to New York's £40 million and Paris's £13 million—Britain led the world in deposit banking.

**How deposit creation works** (for general readers): When a Manchester merchant requests a £1,000 loan, the bank doesn't hand over existing money—it simply writes "£1,000" in the merchant's account, creating new purchasing power through bookkeeping. The merchant writes cheques against this new deposit. When the supplier deposits the cheque at their bank, total deposits in the system have increased by £1,000. **The loan literally created the deposit**. This is fundamentally identical to note issuance—both are private money creation—but operates through accounting entries rather than physical printing.

**The Currency School's fatal error**: The 1844 Act reflected Currency School doctrine that excessive note issuance caused inflation and crises. They mandated 100% gold backing for Bank of England notes beyond a £14 million fiduciary issue. But they **completely misunderstood that deposits functioned identically to notes**. As one source summarizes: "The result of this tragic error on bank deposits meant that fractional reserve banking did not end in England after 1844, but simply changed to focusing on demand deposits instead of notes." Banks immediately exploited this loophole. Scottish banks, for instance, "shifted to deposits" after the 1845 Act restricted their note issue.

**When did economists understand this?** Tragically late. The Banking School in the 1840s recognized deposits functioned like notes but failed to clearly articulate the creation mechanism. **John Stuart Mill** (1848) acknowledged deposits operated "exactly parallel in every respect to bank notes" yet explicitly denied credit could "make something out of nothing"—the precise thing deposit creation does. **Walter Bagehot** (1873) brilliantly analyzed deposit banking's operations but, according to reviewers, "would reject the idea that banks create money. Banks cannot create money. They accept deposits, and then they can loan out some portion of those deposits."

Not until **Keynes's *Treatise on Money* (1930)** do we find explicit recognition: "It is evident that there is no limit to the amount of bank money which the banks can safely create provided that they move forward in step." Banks create deposits by buying assets or making loans. Yet Keynes retreated to more ambiguous treatment in his 1936 *General Theory*, perpetuating confusion. The full articulation awaited Post-Keynesian economists: **Basil Moore** (1988) systematically explained that "loans create deposits," banks accommodate creditworthy demand, and central banks supply reserves to maintain interest rate targets.

**The transformation of British banking**: The 1826 reform allowed joint-stock banks, ending the six-partner restriction. Major banks emerged: **Lloyds** (origins 1765, joint-stock 1865), the **London & Westminster** (1834, first London joint-stock bank), and most famously **Barclays** (1896 through amalgamation of 20 Quaker-owned private banks). By 1914, Britain had 38 shareholder-owned banks operating 5,869 branches—one branch per 6,300 people, double England's earlier rate. These joint-stock banks focused on **deposits rather than notes** because they were barred from London note issuance and because deposit banking was profitable and unregulated.

**International comparison**: Britain led the deposit transition. By 1873, French deposits were only £13 million despite £59 million in notes; Germany had £8 million in deposits. Britain's earlier banking tradition, legal/political stability, and the 1844 Act's unintended incentive all accelerated the shift.

### American Exceptionalism: Fragmented Banking and Repeated Crises (1780-1913)

The United States followed a radically different path: **no sustained central bank, thousands of small unit banks, and recurring financial panics**. This 30% geographic focus reveals how structure shapes stability.

**The First and Second Banks of the United States** were quasi-public institutions (80% private, 20% government ownership) with money creation powers. The **First Bank (1791-1811)** circulated ~$5 million in notes (20% of money supply) and acted as fiscal agent but not true central bank. It died in 1811 by one-vote Senate margin, killed by state bank opposition, foreign ownership concerns, and states' rights ideology. The **Second Bank (1816-1836)**, though successful in stabilizing credit, fell victim to Andrew Jackson's populist crusade. His 1832 veto message attacked "prostration of our Government to the advancement of the few at the expense of the many." After removal of federal deposits to state "pet banks" and political warfare with Bank President Nicholas Biddle, the Second Bank's federal charter expired in 1836.

**State banks exploded**: From 30 banks (1800) to **381 (1830)** to **1,562 (1860)**—a 377% increase in 40 years. State banks issued their own distinctive notes, each regulated by different state laws. By 1860, **nearly 9,000 different note varieties circulated**, with approximately one-third counterfeit. Notes traded at discounts based on distance from issuing bank and perceived bank quality—merchants consulted "banknote reporters" listing current discount rates.

**The "free banking" era (1837-1863)** is misnamed: banks still required state charters, but under "general incorporation laws" rather than special legislative acts. Eighteen states adopted free banking, with varying success. **New York's system (1838-1863)** worked reasonably well after initial turbulence: banks deposited approved securities with state authorities, who liquidated collateral if banks failed. Average bank lifespan was eight years; note losses when banks failed typically were 3% or less.

**Michigan (1837-1843)** represents the disaster scenario: broad acceptance of dubious collateral, temporary suspension of specie payments, and widespread fraud. One bank had "no assets at all"; others transferred notes without security. **Note losses reached 30-60%** in early years. This became the poster child for "wildcat banking"—allegedly banks located "where wildcats roam" to avoid redemption.

Modern research by Rolnick & Weber (1982-1984) and Rockoff (1974) substantially revises this narrative: true wildcat banking (banks failing within one year) was rare. Most failures resulted from **falling asset prices**, particularly when state bonds used as collateral depreciated during the 1840s debt crises. Wisconsin and Illinois banks collapsed when Civil War onset crashed Southern state bond prices. The "wildcat" story was exaggerated, though instability was real.

**The Suffolk Bank System (1824-1858)** demonstrated private clearing could work. The Suffolk Bank in Boston required member banks to maintain deposits for clearing, providing daily net settlement of banknote transactions. By 1838, virtually all New England banks (300+) participated. **New England banknotes circulated at par throughout the region**—unique in antebellum America. During the Panic of 1837, Suffolk even acted as lender of last resort to members. However, critics note Suffolk's monopoly profits suggest market power rather than pure efficiency, and by 1858 member banks had gained legislative power to force the system's end.

**The National Banking System (1863-1913)** attempted to create uniform national currency and finance the Civil War. National banks deposited Treasury bonds with the Comptroller of the Currency, receiving notes worth up to 100% of bond market value (initially 90%). **Reserve requirements** were tiered: country banks (15% reserves, 3/5 could be held in larger banks), reserve city banks (25%, half in central reserve cities), and central reserve city banks (25% all in vault). The 1865 **10% tax on state bank notes** devastated note circulation: from $238.7 million (1863) to $4 million (1867).

Yet state banks **survived by creating deposits**. The Supreme Court upheld the tax in *Veazie Bank v. Fenno* (1869), but state banks discovered deposits (checking accounts) weren't taxed. By 1896, state banks exceeded national banks in number. **By 1913: 7,473 national banks but 15,526 state banks**—the dual banking system born of regulatory arbitrage.

**Reserve pyramiding** created systemic fragility. Country banks held reserves in reserve city banks; reserve cities held reserves in New York, Chicago, or St. Louis; central reserve city banks lent reserves as "call loans" to the stock market. O.M.W. Sprague (1910) identified the fatal flaw: during panics, country banks withdrew from city banks simultaneously, forcing liquidation of call loans, crashing stock prices, and creating cascading bank failures.

**Financial panics** punctuated the era: **1873** (railroad overbuilding, Jay Cooke & Co. failure), **1893** (4,000 bank failures, 14,000 business failures, most severe 19th-century crisis), and **1907** (trust company runs, J.P. Morgan private rescue). The **Panic of 1907** directly catalyzed reform: the Federal Reserve Act (1913) created 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks (privately owned by member banks) supervised by a presidentially appointed Federal Reserve Board—a hybrid public-private structure compromising between banker control and government oversight.

**Comparison to Britain**: Why did the US suffer more crises? **Unit banking restrictions** prevented geographic diversification (Britain allowed branch banking), creating thousands of small, undiversified banks vulnerable to local shocks. **No effective lender of last resort** after 1836 (Britain had the Bank of England, however reluctant). **Regulatory fragmentation** across 30+ state systems. **Easier entry** under free banking meant more marginal banks. The **seasonal agricultural credit cycle** caused predictable fall panics. Structure mattered more than regulation.

**Did US banks create more private money?** Absolutely. Throughout 1811-1863, **state banks were the only source of paper money** (federal government issued no paper currency until 1862 Greenbacks). Even under National Banking, thousands of banks issued notes and, increasingly, created deposits. By quantity and diversity of issuers, US private money creation exceeded Britain's.

### Scottish Exception: Free Banking Success (1716-1845)

Scotland offers the **most successful historical example of competitive private banking**, contrasting sharply with both English country banks and American state banks. Over 129 years, Scotland demonstrated that lightly regulated banking could combine stability with innovation.

**Origins**: When the Bank of Scotland's monopoly expired in 1716, competitive banking emerged. The **Royal Bank of Scotland** (chartered 1727) introduced the **overdraft** (cash credit) on May 31, 1728—the first recorded credit line. The **British Linen Company** (1746), originally for linen industry promotion, gradually evolved into banking, becoming "arguably the first bank in the world to have a branch network."

**The system**: No central bank monopoly, no reserve requirements, no deposit insurance—but also **not purely laissez-faire**. Unlimited liability for non-chartered banks (creating strong incentives for prudence), compulsory note exchange through weekly clearings, and gradual restrictions (option clause banned 1765, small notes under £1 sterling prohibited).

**Note exchange discipline** was key: Banks met weekly in Edinburgh to net banknote balances. If Bank A accumulated Bank B's notes, Bank B had to settle in specie, London deposits, or securities. This "law of reflux" prevented over-issuance—excessive note issuers would face adverse clearings and reserve drains. Banks even hired "note pickers" to collect rival's notes for surprise redemption demands, testing reserve adequacy. White (1995) emphasizes this private prudential regulation worked effectively.

**The option clause** (1730s-1765) is historically fascinating: banknotes included a clause allowing banks to defer redemption for six months while paying 5% interest. This protected against sudden redemption demands and "note wars" between banks. Modern free banking theorists (Selgin) see this as a private alternative to central bank lender-of-last resort. The 1765 Banking Act banned it, arguably making the system less stable.

**Failure record**: Remarkably low. The **Ayr Bank (1772)** was the spectacular exception—founded 1769, liabilities reached £1.3 million before June 1772 collapse. Causes included reckless lending to long-term capital projects, over-issuance, fraud, and mismanagement. Critically, **unlimited liability meant shareholders bore entire loss; noteholders were paid in full**. Partners issued a £500,000 bond secured by £3 million in personal estates, taking 20-60 years to fully wind up, but creditors didn't lose money.

**Comparative stability**: Contemporary observers noted "A run upon any bank, such as happens in England sometimes or a panic, are terms the meaning of which is hardly understood in Scotland" (White 1995, p.143). Scottish banks weathered the 1793, 1797, 1825-26, and 1837 crises better than English country banks.

**Economic performance**: Scotland's GDP per capita rose from ~50% of England's (mid-18th century) to nearly equal by mid-19th century. By 1845, Scotland had **banking assets per capita more than twice England's** (£18.05 vs. £9.00) and double the banking density (1.41 offices per 10,000 vs. 0.71). This extensive financial development facilitated industrialization.

**Why more stable?** (1) **Unlimited liability** incentivized prudence; (2) **note exchange system** enforced market discipline; (3) **branch banking** allowed geographic diversification; (4) **joint-stock structure** created large, well-capitalized institutions; (5) **competition** without the severe fragmentation of US unit banking.

**End of free banking (1844-45)**: Peel's Bank Notes (Scotland) Act 1845 prohibited new banks of issue, capped existing banks' note circulation, and required gold backing for increases. Why end a successful system? Not market failure but **political economy**: existing banks **supported** the Acts because they cartelized the market, protecting incumbent market shares from "reckless competitors." Banker Gilbart celebrated: "Our rights are acknowledged—our privileges are extended—our circulation guaranteed—and we are saved from conflicts with reckless competitors."

### Continental Contrasts: Centralized vs. Decentralized (1600-1914)

**France centralized earliest**. Napoleon founded the **Banque de France** (1800) as private company with public responsibilities. It received exclusive note-issuance for Paris (1803), extended nationwide (1848) when departmental banks were absorbed. French notes required high denominations initially (500-1,000 francs) and 100% gold backing to restore confidence after John Law's 1720 disaster and Revolutionary assignats. Private haute banque (Rothschilds, Hottinguer, Mallet) and deposit banks (Crédit Lyonnais 1863, Société Générale 1864) could create deposit money but not issue notes.

**Germany had the most decentralized note issuance**: By 1872, **33 Notenbanken** (note-issuing banks) existed across German states. The **Reichsbank** (established 1876 after unification) became dominant but never achieved complete monopoly—five note-issuing banks coexisted until WWI. However, Germany developed the most extensive **private deposit creation** through universal banks (Deutsche Bank 1870, Dresdner Bank 1872) combining commercial banking, investment banking, and corporate governance. The three-pillar system included private/credit banks, public savings banks (Sparkassen), and cooperatives, all creating deposit money.

**Netherlands' Amsterdam Wisselbank** (1609) was **fully public**, founded by Amsterdam city council to address multiple-currency chaos. Initially maintaining ~100% reserves, it facilitated payments through book-entry transfers, with bank money trading at premium over coins. Critically, it was **NOT a money creator** initially—just a payment facilitator. Only later did it violate reserves by lending to the VOC (Dutch East India Company), leading to insolvency in 1790 and liquidation in 1819.

**Italy** had six competing note-issuers after 1861 unification, leading to instability and scandal. The **Banca Romana** fraud triggered formation of **Banca d'Italia** (1893) through merger of three banks; but complete note monopoly came only in 1926 under Fascist government.

**Switzerland** represents a unique case: **"unfettered" free banking (1826-1881)** with dozens of private note-issuing banks, transitioning to regulated free banking (1881-1907) under the Federal Banknote Act, finally establishing the Swiss National Bank (1907)—the last major European country to centralize note issuance.

**Convergence by 1914?** Central banking spread universally. The classical gold standard (1870-1914) imposed constraints through fixed exchange rates and gold convertibility requirements, limiting note issuance but constraining deposits less. Yet **structural divergence persisted**: Germany maintained universal banking; Britain/US separated commercial and investment banking. France centralized early; US remained fragmented with 23,000 banks by 1913. Bank-industry relations varied from Germany's intimate Hausbank system to Britain's arm's-length lending.

### Twentieth Century: Boom, Bust, and Shadow Banking (1914-2008)

**WWI (1914-1918)** demonstrated unprecedented monetary expansion. Britain's national debt increased tenfold from £650 million (1914) to £7.4 billion (1919). Private banks participated as intermediaries, purchasing war bonds and creating deposits to finance government spending. The US transformed from debtor to creditor nation, with gold reserves rising from $1.9 billion (1914) to $4 billion (1924).

**The 1920s credit boom** saw private banks create massive amounts of credit. Bank loans to brokers and dealers for purchasing/carrying securities increased **32% (1921-1929)**; real estate loans grew **31%**. Persons (1930) documented that "rapid expansion of the physical volume of credit" preceded the crash. Commercial bank loans expanded from **$27 billion (1921) to $36 billion (1929)**. This private money creation fueled speculation and asset bubbles, setting the stage for catastrophe.

**The Great Depression** revealed the dangers of unregulated private money creation. In the US, ~**9,000 banks failed** (1930-1933), one-third of all banks. Money supply contracted ~30% (Friedman & Schwartz 1963). Britain, with its more concentrated banking structure, experienced **zero major bank failures** during this period—a stark contrast demonstrating that structure and regulation matter.

**Regulatory response**: The US **Banking Act of 1933** (Glass-Steagall) separated commercial and investment banking and created **FDIC deposit insurance**, fundamentally constraining private money creation. Capital requirements, examination standards, and prohibited activities limited banks' ability to create money through speculation. Britain relied more on informal Bank of England supervision.

**Bretton Woods (1945-1971)** severely constrained private banking through capital controls, credit regulations, and fixed exchange rates. Yet the **Eurodollar market**, emerging in London (1956-1957), created the first major "offshore" private money system outside national control. European banks accepted dollar deposits and made dollar loans without US regulatory oversight. By the 1960s, Eurodollars totaled tens of billions—**private money creation had gone international**.

**Fiat era and deregulation (1971-2008)**: Nixon's 1971 end of gold convertibility removed the fundamental commodity constraint on money creation. **Deregulation followed**: Britain's "Big Bang" (1986) liberalized financial markets; the US repealed Glass-Steagall (1999), permitting consolidated financial conglomerates. Private credit expanded dramatically: US M2 grew from $1.6 trillion (1980) to $7.4 trillion (2007).

**Shadow banking** emerged as a parallel system creating money-like instruments outside regulation. **Asset-backed commercial paper**, **repo markets**, **money market funds**, and **securitization** all generated money-substitutes. Pozsar et al. (2010) documented shadow banking liabilities reaching ~$20 trillion by 2007—**exceeding traditional banking's ~$13 trillion**. This was private money creation on steroids, completely unconstrained by reserve requirements or deposit insurance premia.

**The 2008 financial crisis** was fundamentally a crisis of excessive private money creation. Banks had doubled broad money supply in seven years (2000-2007). Commercial bank assets reached 85% of US GDP, but including shadow banks, the financial sector was ~180% of GDP. When subprime mortgages underlying securitization chains began defaulting, the entire system seized. **$1+ trillion in bank capital** evaporated; 465 US banks failed (2008-2012), though FDIC insurance prevented Depression-era deposit losses. Shadow banking contracted sharply, destroying trillions in "quasi-money."

**Post-crisis regulation** (Dodd-Frank 2010, Basel III) significantly constrained private money creation through higher capital requirements (Tier 1 rising from ~8% to 12-14%), stress testing, enhanced oversight, and resolution authority. The pattern repeated: crisis of excessive private money creation, followed by state intervention to constrain and regulate.

### The Modern Revelation: Werner and Bank of England (2014)

Two publications in 2014 crystallized what heterodox economists had argued for decades: **banks individually create money out of nothing when they lend**.

**Richard Werner's experiment** provided the first empirical test in banking history. Werner took out an actual €200,000 loan from Raiffeisenbank Wildenberg in Bavaria, Germany, while monitoring the bank's internal records in real-time. The result: the bank did NOT check reserve levels before approving the loan, did NOT transfer funds from reserves or other deposits, but simply created a new deposit entry in Werner's account through accounting. Werner (2014): "This is consistent with the claims of the credit creation theory...money supply is created as 'fairy dust' produced by the banks individually, 'out of thin air'."

This **rejected both** the financial intermediation theory (banks merely lend out deposits) and the fractional reserve multiplier theory (banking system multiplies base money). It confirmed the credit creation theory: **each individual bank creates money when extending credit**.

The **Bank of England's 2014 Quarterly Bulletin** paper (McLeay, Radia, Thomas) provided authoritative confirmation: "Rather than banks receiving deposits when households save and then lending them out, bank lending creates deposits...Commercial banks create money, in the form of bank deposits, by making new loans. When a bank makes a loan...it credits their bank account with a bank deposit of the size of the mortgage. At that moment, new money is created."

This was revolutionary for three reasons: (1) **Source authority**—a major central bank officially stating this; (2) **Explicit challenge to textbooks**—directly contradicting mainstream economics pedagogy; (3) **Timing**—post-2008 crisis moment of questioning orthodoxy. The paper noted that "in normal times, the central bank does not fix the amount of money in circulation" and reserves are not "multiplied up"—rejecting the money multiplier model taught in Mankiw, Bernanke, and countless other textbooks for decades.

Combined, Werner 2014 and Bank of England 2014 represent a **watershed moment**: empirical validation and official acknowledgment of what Post-Keynesian economists (Kaldor, Moore, Minsky) had argued since the 1970s. **Private banks create money**—but as Part II will demonstrate, they can only do so because the state permits and structures this creation.

## PART II: THE HIERARCHY FRAMEWORK—Why Private Money Proves Rather Than Contradicts Chartalism

### Kelton's Hierarchy: The Foundational Theory

**Stephanie Bell's (later Kelton) 1998-2001 papers** established the theoretical framework that resolves the paradox. Building on Minsky's insight that "everyone can create money; the problem is to get it accepted," Bell (2001) argued that **the state's power to impose and enforce tax laws renders its money the most acceptable debt within a hierarchy of monies**.

The hierarchy structures as a pyramid: **State-issued currency** (fiat money) sits at the apex—the "ultimate" promise. **Bank money** (demand deposits) occupies tier two, ranking high because "accepted at State pay-offices," making it "decisive money." Below lie firm promises (commercial paper, bonds) and household promises (credit cards, IOUs).

**Why different acceptability?** Bell's crucial insight: the state determines the **unit of account** by denominating tax liabilities in that unit (dollars, pounds, euros). Since tax liabilities recur continuously, the private sector must constantly obtain state money or state-accepted money to discharge these obligations. Therefore, private contracts are written in the state's unit—everyone is perpetually indebted to government in that unit.

**Taxation, not legal tender**: Following Lerner (1947), Bell stresses it's **tax acceptance that matters**, not legal tender status. Adam Smith recognized this: "A prince, who should enact that a certain proportion of his taxes should be paid in a paper money of a certain kind, might thereby give a certain value to this paper money." Knapp (1924) defined money as "what is accepted at public pay offices." Keynes (1930) noted the state has the power to "enforce the dictionary but also to write the dictionary."

**Bank money subordination** operates through settlement, not convertibility: "While it may appear that the government accepts bank money in payment of taxes, it ultimately accepts only its own currency. When an individual pays her taxes with bank money (draws on her checking account), a conversion to State money occurs (through the clearing process)." When banks settle with each other, they must use **central bank reserves**—state money. As Bell notes, "All depository institutions in the US must hold a designated fraction of legal reserves (State money!) against demand/specified time deposits."

### Historical Evidence: The Pattern Repeats Across Millennia

Every historical period examined confirms the hierarchy. **Ancient Mesopotamia**: Credit was "provided or regulated by" palaces/temples—state-controlled from inception. Private merchant families were intermediaries, not money creators.

**Medieval bills of exchange**: Private innovation, but required **state sanction** through merchant law courts (London 1436) and explicit legislation (Habsburg Netherlands 1537-41) to function as quasi-money. Without legal recognition, bills wouldn't circulate beyond original parties.

**English goldsmith banking** provides the **acid test**: The closest example of truly unauthorized private money, goldsmith receipts circulated 1640-1672 without explicit state sanction. Yet even this required **retrospective legalization** (1697 court confirmations, 1704 Promissory Notes Act). More tellingly, the system **collapsed catastrophically** (1672 Stop of Exchequer), requiring state intervention through the Bank of England (1694) to create a stable framework. Pure private money proved inherently unstable—workable only with state legal infrastructure and crisis resolution mechanisms.

**Country banks** (1700-1844): Though emergent rather than explicitly authorized initially, they operated within common law and were gradually constrained by Parliament (1708, 1826, 1833, 1844 Acts). Their notes were ultimately **subordinate** to Bank of England notes, which became legal tender and dominated reserves. Reserve pyramiding meant country banks held Bank of England liabilities, not gold—private money literally rested on a foundation of proto-central bank money.

**American state banks** provide the clearest negative evidence: Where state foundation weakened, private money collapsed. **Wildcat banks** whose notes weren't accepted for federal obligations circulated at 50-90% discounts or became worthless. Jackson's 1836 **Specie Circular**, refusing bank notes for federal land purchases, was devastating to state bank note values. When **Illinois free banks** (1851-1863) couldn't convert notes because collateral (state bonds) depreciated to 10-30% of par, 48% of banks failed and notes became partially or totally worthless. **Confederate currency** provides the ultimate example: when the state collapsed in 1865, notes became completely valueless despite having been legal tender.

**The pattern**: In every case where private money couldn't convert to state money (whether commodity money accepted by the state or fiat state money), private money's value collapsed. Success required either direct state sanction or operating within state-created legal and monetary frameworks.

### The Four Pillars of Hierarchy

**Pillar I: Taxation Creates Ultimate Acceptability**

Modern practice illustrates the mechanism: The IRS accepts checks and electronic payments (bank money), but settlement occurs in Federal Reserve reserves. The check clears through the Fed, the bank's reserve account is debited, the Treasury is credited—the state ultimately receives **its own money** (reserves), not the bank's promise. Historical examples reinforce this: **National Bank notes** (1863-1935) were accepted for federal taxes because backed by Treasury bonds—effectively state-guaranteed. **State bank notes** pre-1863 generally weren't accepted, severely limiting their acceptability. When Jackson's Specie Circular (1836) refused bank notes for land purchases, this government rejection devastated note values—proving tax acceptance drives acceptability.

**Pillar II: Convertibility and Settlement**

The Bank for International Settlements (2024) explains modern architecture: "Central bank reserves are...the ultimate means of settlement...an essential anchor for stability." Andrew Bailey (Bank of England, 2024) adds: central banks "ensure convertibility...by providing...an ultimate risk-free asset." **Interbank settlement** requires central bank reserves through RTGS systems (Fedwire, CHAPS, TARGET2). Even though the public holds bank deposits, banks hold central bank reserves—a **two-tier system** where the second tier depends on the first.

Historical convertibility failures prove the dependence: **Illinois free banking** (1851-1863) banks held state bonds as reserves; when bond prices collapsed (Southern bonds to 10-30% of par in 1861), banks **couldn't redeem notes** and 48% failed. **Michigan wildcat banks** (1837-1840) with empty tills when redemption demanded saw notes become "literally worthless within months." **Panic of 1893** suspensions cascaded when banks couldn't convert to gold; 74 national banks failed, with banks most dependent on correspondent relationships most likely to close. **Civil War greenbacks** traded at ~50% of gold value when specie convertibility was suspended, only recovering when resumption expected. The common thread: **when conversion to state money became impossible, private money collapsed**.

**Pillar III: Regulatory Foundation**

Banks create money only with state permission. **Charters**: Pre-1837 US required special legislative acts; 1837-1863 "free banking" still required state charters meeting statutory requirements; post-1863 dual system (state OR federal charter) but always state-granted permission required. **Without charter, creating money-substitutes is illegal** (counterfeiting). **Reserve requirements**: National Bank Act (1863) mandated 15-25% reserves; requirements varied over time (eliminated 2020), but even without mandates, **settlement demands require reserves**. **Lender of last resort**: 2008 demonstrated this dramatically—Fed emergency lending prevented private money collapse through massive state intervention. **Deposit insurance**: FDIC (1933) explicitly guarantees deposits up to $250,000, backstopped by Treasury—the state explicitly standing behind private money, making bank deposits "safe" because the government guarantees them.

**Pillar IV: Unit of Account**

The most fundamental hierarchy mechanism: States determine the **unit of account** through tax denomination. Banks can create deposits, but **cannot change what unit they're denominated in**. The dollar, pound, or euro exists because the state taxes in that unit. Private sector must hold that unit to discharge obligations. Every contract in the economy is written in the state's unit because everyone is perpetually indebted to government (taxes recur continuously). Wray emphasizes: "The state determines not only the unit in which all of the monies in the hierarchy are denominated but also influences the positioning of certain monies within the hierarchy."

### Responding to the Free Banking Critique

Free banking advocates (Selgin, White, Hayek) argue competitive note issuance worked historically and hierarchy isn't necessary—banks could settle in commodity money (gold) without state money.

**The chartalist synthesis response** has five elements:

**(1) "Private money creation PROVES chartalism"**: Extensive private money creation requires state foundation. Banks create money because: the state defines the unit of account (through tax), the state licenses banks (charters), the state provides the settlement medium (reserves), and the state backstops the system (LOLR, insurance). The question isn't "which creates money?" but "what determines acceptability?" Wray: Private credit money and state money are complementary, not contradictory.

**(2) "Free banking required state foundation"**: Scotland operated under Parliamentary charter, settled in Bank of England notes (ultimately state money), and faced regulatory constraints (option clause ban 1765, small note ban). Canada used gold standard (but gold's role as money derived partly from government acceptance for taxes) and required bank charters. Sweden operated within state-defined legal framework. **None were truly stateless**—all operated within legal frameworks defining what money is. Even "free banking" required some banks' notes to be more acceptable than others, creating clearinghouse hierarchies—replicating at private level what exists at national level.

**(3) "Settlement always requires hierarchy"**: Banks must settle in something outside their own liabilities. Historically: gold/silver (but these became money partly through state acceptance). Modern: central bank reserves. Even commodity money gained special status through state acceptance—**states determine what is the ultimate settlement medium**. Free banking advocates acknowledge banks need "base money" for settlement; the question is whether this must be state-issued. Chartalists respond that even commodity base money operated within state-created property law and enforcement frameworks.

**(4) "Stability overstated"**: White's Scottish portrayal has been challenged—failures occurred, and Scottish banks actually weathered crises better because they had access to Bank of England as backstop (even if informal). US free banking's mixed record reflected that "free" was misnomer—heavy regulation existed (bond collateral requirements, single-office restrictions). Crises developed when convertibility failed (bond prices fell, gold shortages). "Successful" free banking systems depended on state-enforced convertibility laws, access to state-backed settlement (gold from government mints), and state regulation preventing worst abuses.

**(5) "Quantity vs. foundation"**: True, banks create ~90% of broad money supply, but this doesn't address what drives acceptability. Analogy: private builders construct most buildings, but on a foundation of state-enforced property rights. Banks create deposits because **the state grants them permission** (charter = delegation of state monetary authority). All bank-created money ultimately settles in central bank reserves created/destroyed by the state. Bank deposits are acceptable because accepted for taxes, convertible (by law) to state currency, and guaranteed by the state (deposit insurance).

### Resolution of the Critical Questions

**1. Was private money creation ever truly "unauthorized" or always state-sanctioned?**

Only **English goldsmith banking (1640-1672)** comes close to purely unauthorized private money. But even this operated in a legal gray area, required retrospective state legalization (1697, 1704), and collapsed catastrophically (1672), necessitating state intervention (Bank of England 1694). Every other example either had explicit state charters (Stockholms Banco 1656, Amsterdam Wisselbank 1609, Bank of Scotland 1695) or emerged within state-defined legal frameworks (medieval bills of exchange required merchant court recognition). **Verdict**: Purely autonomous private money was attempted once for 32 years and failed. All successful private money required state sanction, whether prospective or retrospective.

**2. When did private banks create MORE money than states?**

**England c. 1810**: Banknotes (Bank of England + country banks) represented ~60% of money supply, with country banks contributing substantially to that total—**private issuers collectively created more money than the state's paper issue**. **United States 1811-1863**: After First Bank expired (1811) and before National Banking System (1863), state banks were the ONLY source of paper money—**100% of paper money was privately created during this period**, with the federal government creating zero paper currency. Post-1863, state banks survived via deposit creation; by 1913, 15,526 state banks exceeded 7,473 national banks in number. **Modern era (1971-2008)**: Private bank deposits comprised 80-90% of broad money supply globally.

**3. Has the mechanism changed fundamentally or is deposit creation the same as note issuance?**

**Fundamentally identical**. Both are forms of bank credit money—promises to pay issued by banks that circulate as money. Note issuance: bank prints physical IOUs when lending, which circulate. Deposit creation: bank creates electronic/ledger IOUs when lending, accessed via checks/cards. The economic function is identical: both represent claims on the bank that circulate as money. Bank of England (2014): "Money creation in practice differs from some popular misconceptions—rather than banks lending out deposits that are placed with them, the act of lending creates deposits." The only difference is form (physical vs. electronic), not substance.

**4. Why did states allow/encourage private money creation?**

Multiple reasons: **(a) Fiscal benefit**: Governments borrowed from private banks, which created deposits/notes to fund state spending—easier than extracting taxes; **(b) Economic development**: Private credit creation financed industrial revolution, trade expansion, infrastructure—genuine social benefit; **(c) Political economy**: Banking interests gained political power, lobbied for favorable rules (1844-45 Acts cartelized UK banking at incumbents' request); **(d) Insufficient understanding**: Until Keynes (1930), even sophisticated economists didn't fully grasp that deposit creation = money creation, so regulators didn't realize they were permitting massive private money expansion when they ignored deposits while regulating notes; **(e) Regulatory arbitrage**: Banks innovated around restrictions (deposits to avoid note regulations post-1844), and by the time regulators noticed, the practice was entrenched.

**5. Best historical examples of hierarchy in action (private money collapsing when convertibility failed)?**

**Ranked by clarity**: **(1) Illinois free banking (1851-1863)**: Bond collateral depreciated, banks couldn't convert notes, 48% failed, notes became partially/totally worthless—the most documented case; **(2) Michigan wildcat banks (1837-1840)**: Remote locations, excess note printing, empty tills when redemption demanded, notes became literally worthless; **(3) Panic of 1893**: New York suspension cascaded, rural banks couldn't convert correspondent deposits, 4,000 banks failed; **(4) Confederate currency**: State collapse made notes completely worthless despite initial acceptance and legal tender status; **(5) English country bank failures in 1825-26 crisis**: 71 banks failed (10% of total), though recovery rates varied.

**Common thread**: In every case, **inability to convert to state money led to collapse of private money value**—proving hierarchy is not theoretical but operational reality throughout history.

## Conclusion: The Enduring Necessity of the State Foundation

The historical record is unambiguous: **private money creation, though extensive, has always required state foundation to function stably**. From Mesopotamian state-controlled credit to modern central bank reserves, attempts at purely private money without state sanction have either required retrospective legalization or ended in collapse.

The English country banks era (1700-1844) and American state banking (1780-1863) represent the high-water mark of private money creation—yet both operated within state-defined legal frameworks, settled ultimately in state-sanctioned money, and required regulatory intervention after crises. Scottish free banking's success depended on access to Bank of England and operating within British legal institutions. Where convertibility to state money failed (wildcat banks, Confederate currency, Illinois free banks), private money became worthless.

The deposit banking revolution (1844-1914) demonstrated that even sophisticated economists (Mill, Bagehot, Marshall) failed to recognize that banks were creating money through lending rather than lending pre-existing deposits. This intellectual blind spot enabled **the greatest regulatory failure in banking history**—the 1844 Bank Charter Act regulated visible banknotes while ignoring invisible deposits, allowing unconstrained fractional reserve deposit creation for seven decades. Not until Post-Keynesian economists (Moore 1988) and finally central banks themselves (Bank of England 2014, Werner 2014) was the mechanism clearly articulated.

Modern shadow banking (1990s-2008) replayed the 19th-century pattern: financial innovation created money-substitutes outside regulation, excessive private money creation fueled bubbles, collapse necessitated state intervention (2008 bailouts, Dodd-Frank, Basel III). The cycle repeats because the underlying dynamics are constant.

**Kelton's hierarchy framework resolves the paradox**: Private banks create most money, yet this doesn't contradict chartalism—it proves it. Banks can create money only because: (1) the state defines the unit of account through tax denomination; (2) the state grants permission through bank charters; (3) banks must settle in state money (central bank reserves); (4) the state backstops the system through lender of last resort and deposit insurance. Private money is leveraged on a base of state money. When that foundation crumbles—when banks can't convert to state money—private money collapses.

The evidence across 5,000 years leads to one conclusion: **Money is always a creature of the state, even when the state delegates creation to private banks**. Extensive private money creation requires, rather than contradicts, state monetary sovereignty. The question for the 21st century—as we debate cryptocurrency, central bank digital currencies, and financial innovation—is not whether private money can exist independently of the state, but how states will structure the frameworks within which private money creation occurs.

The history teaches that successful monetary systems balance private innovation with public foundation. The country banks financed Britain's Industrial Revolution, but required the Bank of England's framework. American state banks mobilized capital across a growing nation, but fragmentation created instability resolved only by federal intervention. Scottish free banking thrived for 129 years, but within British legal and monetary institutions. Every successful case of private money creation operated on a foundation the state provided—through law, through settlement systems, through crisis backstops.

As we confront 21st-century monetary innovation, this history offers a clear lesson: **private creativity and public foundation are complements, not substitutes**. The extensive history of private money creation, from goldsmith receipts to shadow banking, proves rather than contradicts the chartalist insight that state money, enforced through taxation and settlement hierarchies, forms the bedrock on which all money rests.
