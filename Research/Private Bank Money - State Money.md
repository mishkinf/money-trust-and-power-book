# Private Bank Money Always Rested on the State Foundation

The historical record reveals a critical truth: **private banks have created the majority of money in circulation since the 1700s, yet this private money creation never contradicted chartalist theory—it proved it**. Bank-issued money, whether provincial notes in Georgian England or checking accounts in modern America, derived its value from convertibility into state-backed money needed for tax payments. The hierarchy was always present, even when obscured by hundreds of competing private issuers. This two-tier system—central bank base money supporting commercial bank credit—emerged through political compromise and market evolution, not economic theory, crystallizing in England after 1844 and in America after 1913.

Understanding this history demolishes a persistent misconception. Critics argue that widespread private money creation disproves the claim that taxation drives money's value. But the evidence shows the opposite: **private bank notes circulated precisely because they were convertible into Bank of England notes, which alone could pay taxes**. When country banks suspended convertibility during crises, their notes collapsed in value. The hierarchy wasn't theoretical—it was functional, enforced daily through interbank settlement, regulatory privilege, and the state's monopoly on legal tender designation. Modern empirical research, including Richard Werner's 2014 study and the Bank of England's candid 2014 admission, confirms that even as banks create deposits "out of nothing," they remain dependent on central bank reserves for final settlement. Private money creation rests on a public foundation.

## Country banks dominated England's money supply by 1800

England's monetary system transformed dramatically in the eighteenth century as private provincial banks—"country banks"—proliferated outside London and began issuing their own paper currency. This wasn't planned centralization but market-driven expansion. By 1784, more than 100 country banks existed; **by 1810, over 700 banks issued approximately £22 million in notes**, compared to the Bank of England's smaller circulation. These weren't marginal institutions. During the Napoleonic suspension period (1797-1821), when specie payments halted, country bank notes represented **the bulk of England's circulating money supply**. One careful assessment found that in the early 1830s, country banks still issued around **60 percent of all banknotes in England**, demonstrating their dominance before the 1844 reforms.

The geographic spread was comprehensive. Every industrial city—Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle, Liverpool—had multiple note-issuing banks. Each operated within local networks, accepting notes from a small number of partner banks while rejecting distant issuers. This created fragmented monetary zones where Birmingham notes might trade at par in nearby towns but at discounts further away. The system worked through trust and proximity: a country bank's notes circulated where its reputation was known and where holders could reasonably expect to redeem them. Yet underneath this apparent decentralization lay a critical foundation. Country banks increasingly held Bank of England notes as reserves, "pyramiding their own notes on top of them," as one monetary historian documented. The structure was hierarchical from the start.

Parliament's 1708 restriction played a decisive but often misunderstood role. By prohibiting partnerships of more than six persons from issuing notes (protecting the Bank of England's corporate monopoly in London), the law kept country banks small, undercapitalized, and vulnerable. They couldn't achieve economies of scale. Yet this weakness paradoxically enabled their proliferation—barriers to entry were low for small partnerships. The resulting system combined entrepreneurial dynamism with structural fragility. Hundreds of small, thinly capitalized banks issued currency backed by fractional reserves of Bank of England notes and gold. When the Bank expanded or contracted its note issue, country banks amplified the effect, creating procyclical instability that reformers would target in 1844.

## The tax payment hierarchy revealed which money was sovereign

One fact establishes the monetary hierarchy beyond dispute: **the Exchequer accepted Bank of England notes for tax payments but not country bank notes**. This wasn't a technicality—it was the foundational distinction between state-backed money and private substitutes. From the Bank of England's 1694 founding, the government "agreed to accept Bank of England issued banknotes for tax payment." Country banks' notes, regardless of how widely they circulated in provincial trade, could not discharge tax obligations. A Lancashire merchant might accept Manchester bank notes for wool, but when tax day arrived, those notes had to be converted into Bank of England money. This conversion requirement—this need to obtain the specific money the state would accept—is precisely what chartalist theory predicts drives money's value.

The legal framework reinforced this hierarchy. Bank of England notes received **legal tender status in 1833** for sums above £5, "effectively guaranteeing the worth of the Bank's notes and ensuring public confidence in the notes in times of crisis or war." Country bank notes never achieved this status. When the state prosecuted counterfeiters, it made counterfeiting Bank of England notes **punishable by death**, providing enforcement that protected note integrity. This differential legal treatment—Bank notes legally privileged, country notes merely tolerated—reflected and reinforced the hierarchy. By the 1760s, according to monetary historian Keith Horsefield, "the Bank's notes were generally regarded as 'proper money,' long before they were officially made legal tender in 1833."

The payment system architecture embodied this hierarchy. Country banks held correspondent relationships with London banks, which in turn held accounts at the Bank of England. Payments moved up and down this pyramid. A payment from Newcastle to Bristol would settle through London correspondents using Bank of England balances. The entire structure rested on the foundation of Bank reserves. As Charles Goodhart documents, after 1833, country banks "took to keeping virtually all of their reserves at the Bank of England, demanding cash, or gold, from the Bank as necessary." This wasn't optional. Banks needed Bank of England money to settle with each other, to meet customer redemptions, and ultimately to enable their customers to pay taxes. The hierarchy was functional, not merely formal.

## Peel's 1844 Act inadvertently created modern banking

The Bank Charter Act of 1844 represents one of history's great unintended consequences. Robert Peel and the Currency School economists crafted legislation to end fractional reserve banking and establish 100% gold backing for new note issuance. They succeeded in destroying private note issuance. They utterly failed to control credit creation. The Act **prohibited new banks from issuing notes** anywhere in Britain, froze existing country banks' issuance at 1844 levels, and mandated that banks would **lose note-issuing rights upon merger**. Combined with the requirement that new Bank of England notes be backed 100% by gold (above a £14 million fiduciary issue), Peel believed he had ended monetary inflation caused by excessive bank credit.

The mechanism worked through economic attrition rather than direct prohibition. In 1844, **277 country banks issued £8.6 million in notes** compared to £21 million from the Bank of England. Unable to expand note circulation as the economy grew, note issuance became increasingly unprofitable for country banks. When banks merged—and industrialization accelerated merger activity—note privileges lapsed and transferred to the Bank of England. By 1880, only 157 banks issued notes worth barely £6 million. By 1914, just 11 banks issued £401,719. **Fox, Fowler and Company issued the last private English banknote in 1921**, completing a 77-year transition to Bank of England monopoly.

But the Currency School made what critics would call a "tragic error": they assumed bank deposits weren't money. They focused obsessively on paper notes while ignoring checking accounts and deposit transfers. The Act "only stopped the creation of paper bank notes—it didn't refer to other substitutes for money, such as bank deposits." Banks immediately pivoted. As Goodhart writes, "Both the Bank of England and the country banks, deprived of the right to issue notes at will, began to issue deposits to a fare-thee-well." **Fractional reserve banking didn't end in England after 1844; it simply changed to focusing on demand deposits instead of notes**. Credit creation continued unabated, now in forms the Act didn't regulate. By the twentieth century, bank deposits constituted **99.91% of transactions by value**, with cash representing just 0.09%. Peel had banned visible private money while accidentally authorizing invisible private money creation on an unprecedented scale.

## America's Free Banking Era proved the hierarchy through failure

The United States experimented with decentralized private money creation more extensively and chaotically than Britain. During the Free Banking Era (1837-1863), following the demise of the Second Bank of the United States, banking was left entirely to state regulation. Over half the states enacted "free banking" laws allowing automatic chartering for banks meeting minimal requirements. **Approximately 2,300 banks existed before the Civil War**, with around three-eighths operating under free banking statutes. This meant literally thousands of different bank notes circulating, each with varying acceptability. In New York, the number of banks rose from 97 before the 1838 law to 162 within three years. In Michigan, banks exploded from 10 to 33 in one year. The monetary landscape resembled anarchy—even drugstores and railroad companies issued notes, and approximately **one-third of all paper currency during this period was counterfeit**.

The quality varied dramatically by state regulatory framework. New York required solid collateral—state bonds or secure mortgages—and imposed meaningful supervision. New York banknotes "usually traded around 99 percent" of face value even out of state, and by the decade's end, New York banks were remarkably stable. Michigan allowed dubious private mortgage-backed bonds as collateral and temporarily suspended specie payment requirements. Michigan notes "lost 30 to 60 percent of their value in those early years" as loans backing bank reserves defaulted. The term "wildcat banking" emerged from Michigan's boom-and-bust, though research by Rolnick and Weber later showed that "about half of all banks in those states closed during the free-banking era, but many of those failed banks still redeemed their notes at par," suggesting that banking instability had multiple causes beyond fraud.

The chaos demonstrated hierarchy through dysfunction. Bank notes were legally redeemable in specie—gold or silver coins. But with thousands of issuers of varying creditworthiness, notes traded at discounts reflecting redemption costs and default risk. "Note brokers" profited by purchasing out-of-state notes at discounts and traveling to redeem them. The Suffolk Bank System in New England created private clearing arrangements where member banks deposited 2% of capital as collateral and Suffolk cleared all member notes at par daily. This worked well—bank failure rates remained low even during panics—but it worked precisely because it replicated central banking functions through private cooperation. The system demonstrated that final settlement required a common reserve medium, whether provided by the state or by private banks acting collectively.

## The National Banking Acts standardized without centralizing

Congress passed the National Currency Act in 1863 (amended 1864 as the National Bank Act) to finance the Civil War and reform the monetary chaos. Unlike Britain's Bank Charter Act, which eliminated private note issuance, the American legislation **created a new class of federally-chartered private banks that could issue standardized notes**. Banks deposited U.S. Treasury bonds with the Comptroller of the Currency and received national bank notes worth up to 90% of the bond value. These notes were uniform in design, backed by government bonds, and "satisfactory for nearly all payments to and by the federal government," though not general legal tender. By 1864, 683 banks received federal charters; by 1913, **7,473 national banks existed**, all issuing their own notes. This was still private money creation, merely standardized and collateralized.

The transformation came through taxation, not prohibition. An 1865 amendment imposed a **10% tax on state bank notes**, making their issuance uneconomical. State bank note circulation "fell from $143 million in 1865 to $4 million by 1867"—effectively eliminated through punitive taxation rather than direct ban. But state banks discovered the same workaround as English country banks after 1844: deposits. "By the 1880s, deposit accounts had changed the primary source of revenue for many banks," and "by the 1890s, **90% of the money supply was in checking accounts**." Individual deposits grew from 5% to 23% of GDP between 1863 and 1913, with deposits rising from 96% to 592% of bank capital. State banking made a dramatic comeback through deposit creation, which faced no equivalent tax.

The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 finally centralized the American system, though more gradually than Britain's century-long consolidation. The Fed was designed to "furnish an elastic currency" and serve as "lender of last resort" during liquidity crises. Federal Reserve notes debuted in 1914 as "just one more option in the American currency market," competing with U.S. Treasury notes, silver certificates, gold certificates, and national bank notes. The transition took decades. The last national bank notes were issued in 1929. The system fully consolidated in the 1930s when "U.S. currency was consolidated into Federal Reserve Notes, United States Notes, and silver certificates." By then, the two-tier system had crystallized: **Federal Reserve base money (notes and reserves) at the foundation, with commercial banks creating deposit money on top**.

## Continental Europe centralized from the beginning

The Anglo-American model of competitive private bank note issuance was exceptional, not universal. Continental Europe favored state-controlled central banking from much earlier. **Napoleon founded the Banque de France on January 18, 1800** as both a private company and "public bank." By 1803, it obtained monopoly note issuance in Paris. By 1805, the government appointed its Governor and Deputy Governors directly. Some departmental banks existed in Bordeaux, Marseille, and Rouen, but the 1848 financial crisis eliminated them, extending the Banque de France's monopoly nationwide. There was no French equivalent to England's proliferation of country banks—centralized control was the system from inception. The Emperor directed monetary policy through appointed officials, maintaining tight state oversight that English Chancellors would have envied.

Germany consolidated through political compromise during unification. By 1870, 33 banks issued notes in territories that would form the German Reich. The Reichsbank was established January 1, 1876, "technically a private-sector company... albeit operated from the start under the close control of the Reich government." The law specified that management "must obey the Chancellor's orders at all times," with the President appointed by the emperor. Existing private banks kept issuance rights but under restrictions that "rapidly fell into monetary irrelevance." By the early twentieth century, all three systems—Bank of England, Banque de France, Reichsbank—operated as "note-issuing banks with practically monopolistic powers," but their paths differed fundamentally: Britain started with competition and centralized gradually; France and Germany centralized immediately through state power.

## The hierarchy of money explains why bank money has value

Modern Monetary Theory's "hierarchy of money" framework, articulated most clearly by Stephanie Kelton (as Stephanie Bell) in her 2001 Cambridge Journal of Economics paper, provides the theoretical architecture for understanding private money creation. **State-issued money sits atop a pyramid, with bank deposits occupying the second tier**. Bank money derives acceptability from state money because central banks guarantee that deposits convert to government currency on demand, deposits are accepted for tax payments, and state guarantees make bank money "nearly as liquid as state money." As Kelton explains, the state "determines not only the unit in which all of the monies in the hierarchy are denominated but also influences the positioning of certain monies within the hierarchy." This isn't abstract theory—it describes the functional reality of how the eighteenth-century country banker and the modern commercial bank both operate.

Kelton built on Hyman Minsky's insight that "everyone can create money, the problem is to get it accepted." Private entities can issue IOUs freely—the question is whether anyone accepts them. Bank money achieves acceptability through its position in the hierarchy: convertible to central bank reserves, which are convertible to currency, which the state accepts for taxes. The state's "monopoly on taxation creates universal demand for its currency," making state money the most acceptable form. Banks piggyback on this acceptability. Their deposits wouldn't circulate without guaranteed convertibility to state money. Historical evidence confirms this. When banks suspended specie payments during crises, their notes traded at discounts or became worthless. When the Bank of England suspended gold convertibility in 1797, country banks "had to redeem their obligations in Bank of England notes," revealing their dependence. The hierarchy wasn't optional—it was the structure that made private issuance possible.

## Interbank settlement proves the hierarchy daily

The technical operation of payment systems demonstrates state money's primacy. When a customer at Bank A pays a customer at Bank B, both banks adjust their internal ledgers, but **final settlement occurs through central bank reserves**. Bank A's reserve account at the central bank is debited; Bank B's reserve account is credited. This happens millions of times daily in real-time gross settlement systems like Fedwire (US) or CHAPS (UK). Settlement cannot occur in bank deposits—only in central bank money. As the Federal Reserve states, "The ability to reliably settle interbank obligations using balances at the central bank (also referred to as central bank money) is vital not only to the smooth functioning of the payment system but also to financial stability more broadly."

This creates irreducible dependence. Banks must have access to central bank reserves to function. They cannot settle with each other using promises; they need the "final" money that extinguishes obligations between institutions. Reserves are IOUs from the central bank to commercial banks—the highest-quality, zero-default-risk asset available. Commercial banks cannot create reserves through lending (though they can borrow them from the central bank). This technical requirement enforces the hierarchy. No matter how much deposit money banks create, they need access to the base layer for settlement. The eighteenth-century country bank holding Bank of England notes as reserves and the modern bank holding Fed reserves at its account are experiencing the same hierarchical reality across three centuries.

## Werner and the Bank of England vindicated Post-Keynesian theory

For decades, economics textbooks taught the "money multiplier" model: banks collect deposits from savers, hold a fraction in reserve (say 10%), and lend out the rest; this process multiplies an initial deposit of $100 into $1,000 of total money supply through sequential re-lending. Central banks supposedly control money supply by controlling reserves. In 2014, this textbook story collapsed under empirical scrutiny and official admission. Richard Werner, in a study titled "Can banks individually create money out of nothing?", conducted **the first empirical test in banking history** of how banks actually create money. He borrowed from a cooperating German bank while monitoring its internal accounting. The finding was definitive: **"This study establishes for the first time empirically that banks individually create money out of nothing"**—banks don't transfer funds from other accounts; they create deposits when they lend.

The same year, the Bank of England published an extraordinary admission in its Quarterly Bulletin. "Money creation in the modern economy," authored by central bank economists, stated plainly: **"Rather than banks lending out deposits that are placed with them, the act of lending creates deposits—the reverse of the sequence typically described in textbooks."** On the money multiplier: "While the money multiplier theory can be a useful way of introducing money and banking in economic textbooks, **it is not an accurate description of how money is created in reality**." This official acknowledgment from a major central bank was historically unprecedented. Central bankers had known the truth for decades—Alan Holmes at the New York Fed noted in 1969 that "banks extend credit, creating deposits in the process, and look for the reserves later"—but public education materials and textbooks continued teaching the multiplier model.

The correct understanding—that loans create deposits—had been articulated by Post-Keynesian economists for decades. Hyman Minsky held an endogenous money view "from his earliest work" in the 1950s, well before the Post-Keynesian revival of the 1980s. Basil Moore's 1988 book "Horizontalists and Verticalists" comprehensively argued that central banks set the price of reserves (interest rate), not the quantity, and that "the supply of credit money is endogenous and responds to changes in the demand for bank credit." Yet textbooks persisted in teaching the multiplier. Why? One textbook author admitted "he does not believe the money multiplier is applicable, yet he and his publisher fear that **dropping that chapter would cut sales**." The multiplier provides neat mathematical exercises and apparent central bank control, making it pedagogically convenient even if empirically false. As Bank of England advisor Charles Goodhart stated in 1984, the multiplier is "**such an incomplete way of describing the process of the determination of the stock of money that it amounts to mis-instruction**."

## Historical understanding was gained, lost, and rediscovered

The intellectual history reveals a pattern of understanding, forgetting, and rediscovery. Early twentieth-century economists grasped credit creation theory remarkably well. Joseph Schumpeter's 1912 "Theory of Economic Development" explicitly described banks creating purchasing power through credit. Albert Hahn's 1920 work on credit creation became a bestseller in Germany, where the theory was "dubbed the 'current view', the 'traditional theory' or the 'time-worn theory of bank credit.'" By the 1920s, credit creation theory enjoyed "fairly widespread" support in English and German academic publications. Then it vanished. From approximately the 1930s through the 1960s, the fractional reserve/"money multiplier" view became dominant. By the late 1960s, financial intermediation theory—treating banks like other financial institutions that merely intermediate between savers and borrowers—dominated mainstream economics.

Post-Keynesian economists maintained the correct understanding throughout this period. Nicholas Kaldor in the 1960s, monetary circuit theorists like Le Bourva in the early 1960s, Hyman Minsky continuously from the 1950s through 1980s, and Basil Moore's comprehensive 1988 treatment kept endogenous money theory alive in heterodox economics. But mainstream macroeconomics taught the multiplier in undergraduate courses and used different models in central banks. Charles Goodhart noted the split in 1984: "virtually every monetary economist believes" the multiplier, while "almost all those who have worked in a central bank" know reserves aren't the binding constraint. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago admitted in 1961 that "the actual process of money creation takes place primarily in banks," but this insight didn't penetrate textbook pedagogy for another half-century.

The 2010s brought official acknowledgment. Werner's 2014 empirical study, the Bank of England's 2014 Quarterly Bulletin paper, and similar statements from the Bundesbank and other central banks marked a watershed. Yet textbooks still lag. The theoretical paradigm remains locked because "remove the money multiplier, and you must re-write the whole book with a fundamentally different theoretical approach." The intellectual inertia is profound. Students learn one model in undergraduate courses, discover it's wrong when working at central banks, but the institutional structures of textbook publishing and curriculum committees change glacially. The correct understanding, articulated in the 1920s and maintained by Post-Keynesians for decades, finally received official endorsement a century later.

## This strengthens rather than contradicts chartalist theory

Critics argue that widespread private money creation disproves the chartalist claim that taxation drives money demand. If banks can create money, why does state money matter? The hierarchy provides the answer: **private money creation depends on state money at every level**. Bank deposits derive value from convertibility into central bank reserves and currency. Central bank money derives demand from tax obligations. The two-tier system doesn't contradict chartalism—it demonstrates how private entities can expand the money supply while remaining fundamentally dependent on the state monetary foundation. Country banks issued notes successfully precisely because those notes converted into Bank of England money, which the Exchequer accepted for taxes. When convertibility failed, private money collapsed.

John Clapham's definitive 1944 history documents that "Bank notes were not yet King's money, but they were getting near to it"—recognizing the quasi-governmental status that underpinned Bank of England notes' value. The state's "punitive system and prerogative to claim future taxes" guaranteed Bank notes' worth for centuries before legal tender designation. Country banks built their note issuance on this foundation, "increasingly using Bank of England notes as reserves and pyramiding their own notes on top of them." When Parliament ended private note issuance through the 1844 Act, it strengthened the hierarchy but didn't create it. The structure was always present: gold convertibility enforced by state mints and legal tender laws, Bank of England notes privileged for tax payments, country bank notes convertible into Bank notes, and deposits convertible into notes.

Modern evidence confirms this architecture persists. Even though banks create **97% of money in circulation** through lending, they need central bank reserves for settlement. The Federal Reserve supplies reserves on demand at its policy interest rate, but banks cannot function without access to this settlement medium. The interest rate the central bank charges influences all other interest rates in the economy, giving monetary policy its leverage. Banks don't need reserves before lending—Werner and the Bank of England proved this conclusively—but they need reserves eventually for settlement and cash withdrawals. This creates the hierarchy: private creation of deposit money rests on a foundation of state-supplied base money. Taxation creates demand for state money, banks need access to state money for operations, and the entire pyramid maintains state money's primacy at the apex. Private money creation is real, substantial, and endogenous—and fundamentally dependent on the state foundation.

## Integration guidance for your book chapters

**Chapter 4 (Bank of England founding)**: Open with 1-2 paragraphs establishing that the Bank's 1694 charter created immediate hierarchy—Exchequer accepted Bank notes for tax payments while no private bank enjoyed this privilege. The two-tier system began here, with the Bank as apex and nascent private banking emerging below.

**Chapter 5 (How Bank Created Money)**: Develop a major section on base money versus bank credit. Use the country banks' emergence in the 1700s to illustrate the hierarchy in practice—provincial banks held Bank of England notes as reserves, pyramiding their own note issuance on this foundation. Emphasize that by 1810, over 700 country banks issued the bulk of circulating money, yet this strengthened rather than contradicted the role of Bank of England money because country notes derived value from convertibility. Include Clapham's observation that Bank notes were "getting near to" King's money even before legal tender status, and document the correspondent banking pyramid that developed with London banks holding Bank deposits and country banks holding London correspondent deposits.

**Chapter 7 (Bank Charter Act 1844)**: Explain how Peel's Act ended note issuance but accidentally created modern banking. The Currency School's "tragic error" was overlooking deposits. Private money creation continued in invisible form—demand deposits and checking accounts replacing paper notes. This section should connect to the US parallel (National Banking Acts taxing state notes, leading to deposit explosion by 1890s). The modern two-tier system crystallized after 1844: Bank of England monopoly on notes, but commercial banks creating money through deposit expansion, all settling in Bank reserves.

**Chapter 8 (Modern System)**: Feature Werner's 2014 empirical demonstration and the Bank of England's extraordinary 2014 admission. Use these to explain that textbooks still teach the wrong model (money multiplier) while central banks have known for decades that loans create deposits. Connect to Post-Keynesian economists (Minsky from 1950s, Moore in 1980s) who maintained correct understanding. Explain interbank settlement in reserves proves the hierarchy—banks create deposits through lending but need central bank money for final settlement. This technical requirement enforces state money's primacy in modern systems just as tax acceptability did historically.

**Epilogue**: Reinforce that three centuries of evidence—from Georgian country banks to modern deposit creation—demonstrates private money always rested on state foundation. The hierarchy isn't abolished by private creation; it's the structure that enables it. Kelton's framework synthesizes historical and modern evidence: state money sits at apex because taxation creates universal demand, bank money occupies second tier because of guaranteed convertibility. Use the Continental comparison to show the Anglo-American model of competitive note issuance was exceptional but even there, centralization eventually occurred. End with the theoretical vindication: Werner and Bank of England in 2014 confirming what heterodox economists argued for decades—banks create money endogenously, but within a hierarchical system where state money remains essential.

## Critical question answers

**Does private bank money creation contradict "taxation drives money demand"?** No—the hierarchy proves the opposite. Bank money derived value from convertibility into state-backed money needed for tax payments. Country banks held Bank of England notes as reserves; those notes were accepted for taxes while country notes were not. When banks suspended convertibility, their notes collapsed. Private creation rested on state foundation.

**When and how did the two-tier system crystallize?** In Britain: gradually after 1844 as Bank of England monopolized notes while commercial banks shifted to deposit creation, complete by early 1900s. In America: after 1913 Federal Reserve creation established base money, with commercial banks creating deposits on top, fully consolidated by 1930s. But the conceptual structure existed earlier—country banks pyramiding on Bank of England notes by late 1700s demonstrated the hierarchy before formal consolidation.

**Why do textbooks still teach money multiplier despite Bank of England correction?** Publisher fears that dropping the chapter would reduce sales; theoretical paradigm lock-in requiring complete book rewrites; pedagogical convenience of simple algebra exercises; gradual institutional change in curriculum; intellectual inertia. As Goodhart stated, the multiplier "amounts to mis-instruction," yet removing it requires abandoning the entire mainstream monetary framework.
