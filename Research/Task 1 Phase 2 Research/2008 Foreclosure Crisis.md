The 2008 Foreclosure Crisis in Human Terms
One illustrative case is Maureen McKenzie of Kirkwood, Missouri – a middle‐class homeowner who bought
modestly and lost everything. In March 2004 McKenzie (a Chamber-of-Commerce bookkeeper) purchased
her small ranch home from her father with a conventional 30‑year mortgage (~$900/month) 1 . Two years
later she refinanced in September 2005 into a 40‑year payment-option ARM for $184,500 2 . The loan had a
teaser rate of just 2.25% initially (payment ≈ $757.95/month) 3 . Within days the rate shot up: on Nov. 4,
2005 the lender notified her that the index‑based rate reset to 7.875% 4 . Her interest-only payment
became $1,367, but the loan’s minimum payment option remained ~$758 5 , meaning nearly $610 of
unpaid interest was added to principal every month.

. Initial

monthly P&I was $583.28 (plus $174 impounds) = $757.95 3 .
• Rate reset (Nov 2005): Interest jumped to 7.875%, raising the interest‑only payment to $1,367.32
4 . McKenzie’s minimum remained $758, so her unpaid interest was being capitalized (negative
amortization) 5 .
• Trigger (Aug 2007): By August 2007 McKenzie’s loan balance hit its cap ($202,950), terminating the
option payment. Her required monthly payment doubled to $1,610.70 6 . McKenzie – now on
disability (fibromyalgia) – could not possibly afford this; even the old $758 was straining her budget
7

.

Unable to meet the new payment, McKenzie ultimately lost her home to foreclosure in May 2008 8 . By
late 2008 she had moved into her second apartment after foreclosure 9 . In her own words she was
“shocked” that the ARM payment gap blew up her principal, and felt the system failed her despite doing
“everything right” to be a responsible borrower 10 9 .
Another example: Sheila Ramos, a Florida small‐business owner and grandmother. After falling behind on
her risky mortgage and being denied a loan modification, Ramos lost her three-bedroom house. She and
her grandchildren eventually ended up living in a tent in Hawaii 11 – a stark portrait of how decent families
were uprooted. (As one report noted, Ramos “wound up living in a tent outside her hometown,” after the
mortgage gave out 11 .)

Lending Terms and Market Context
During 2005–2007 many middle-class buyers were encouraged into subprime/ARM loans with very low
down payments. Introductory ARM rates were often in the mid‑single digits but could reset 2–3 points
higher a few years later. For example, CBS News reported that a $200K ARM originated in the mid-2000s
might start at ~4.5% and climb to ~6.5% at reset 12 (a 24% jump in payment). Caps typically limited yearly
rate increases (~2.5% per year 12 ), but that still meant a 6% initial rate could reach ~9% within a few years.
Down payments had also collapsed. One 2005 survey found 43% of first-time buyers put 0% down (no
money down!), with a median down payment of only ~2% 13 . Even among all buyers, the median down

payment was just 13% (far below the traditional 20%) 13 . In practice many borrowers – like McKenzie –
financed their homes with minimal equity, banking on rising prices.

Scale of the Crisis
The human toll was immense. Estimates suggest on the order of 8–10 million U.S. homeowners lost their
homes to foreclosure from 2007 through 2014 14 . (At the peak of the crisis roughly 1.8 million homes were
foreclosed per year 12 14 .) These were not exclusively speculators or the very poor – many were middle‐
class professionals. For example, pastors noted entire congregations of teachers, probation officers,
engineers and tradesmen facing foreclosure 15 11 .
In short, these stories and figures show how ordinary families who had “done all the right things” – buying a
home, even a small one – were devastated when adjustable loans reset and the bubble burst. Maureen
McKenzie’s case (with documented loan figures 16 8 ) and others like Sheila Ramos underscore the
personal cost behind the statistics.
Sources: Investigative reports and news accounts detail these cases. St. Louis Public Radio documented
McKenzie’s mortgage and foreclosure step by step 17 18 . National reporting (e.g. The Guardian, ABC
News, etc.) and books like Chain of Title provide first-person accounts (e.g. Ramos’s story) and data on
lending terms 11 12 13 14 . These sources reveal the loan terms, payments, and circumstances that led
to foreclosure and their aftermath.
