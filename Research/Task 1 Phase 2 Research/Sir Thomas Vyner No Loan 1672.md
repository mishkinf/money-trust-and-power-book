Sir Thomas Vyner – no loan in 1672 (he died 1665)
Sir Thomas Vyner, 1st Baronet (b.1588), died on 11 May 1665 1 – seven years before Charles II’s 1672
“Stop.” He could not have lent new money to the Crown in 1672. In fact, the often‑quoted £416,724 debt was
owed to Sir Robert Vyner (Sir Thomas’s nephew and business partner) 2 , not to Thomas himself. Sir
Thomas’s will (proved 1665) bequeathed his personal estate to his sons (with his son Thomas as executor)
3 , and directed legacies to family and friends. His goldsmith banking firm effectively passed to his heirs
(and nephew Robert), so any “depositors” in his shop would have been handled by the executors in 1665,
long before the 1672 crisis. In short, Vyner’s own fortunes were settled in 1665 – he was not ruined by the
Stop of the Exchequer (the estate passed to his son and co‐executor Thomas) 3 2 .

Edward Backwell – ruined by 1672 default
A clearer example is Edward Backwell, a leading goldsmith‑banker. By 1672 the Crown owed Backwell huge
sums – about £295,994 (with interest) as later reckoned 4 . When Charles II suspended payments,
Backwell “was brought to his knees” and could not pay his depositors 5 . Over the next decade he continued
in official service but his bank never recovered liquidity. In 1682 he was declared bankrupt, and only by a
private Act of 1698 could his creditors (including former depositors) get any repayment 6 . Backwell died
in exile in 1683 7 ; his remaining assets were wound up by law. In short: Backwell lent ~£296k, was left
unable to honor withdrawals when the Stop hit (depositors lost access), and ultimately went bankrupt 5
6 .

Context – rates, duration, and fallout
Goldsmith bankers normally charged very high rates. In Charles II’s time they often lent at 20–30% annual
interest 8 . (By the 1670s legal caps were 6% on government debt, but goldsmiths actually paid out 6% or
more to win the business 9 .) Charles’s “one‐year” moratorium (January–Dec 1672) was repeatedly
extended – first to May 1673, then January 1674 – and effectively dragged on for years 10 11 . In fact
Davies notes that of the £1.314 million owed in 1677, about 97½% was to the goldsmith‐bankers 2 , and
repayments were heavily delayed. The Stop devastated the goldsmith bankers – as Gilbert Burnet later
wrote, “the bankers were broken, and multitudes who had put their money in their hands were ruined” 12 .
Only a handful of firms survived long term. In practice most London goldsmith‑bankers failed or were
forced out of business in the 1670s 12 10 , while only a few (e.g. Sir Robert Vyner’s heirs, the Hoare family,
etc.) managed to continue.
