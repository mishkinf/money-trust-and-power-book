# Research Prompt: Chapter 9 "Manufacturing Orthodoxy" - Supplemental Details

## Context
I am writing Chapter 9 of a monetary history book about how the Currency School manufactured orthodox economic doctrine in 1820s-1850s Britain through institutional capture. I need additional documented biographical and institutional details to enrich the narrative while maintaining academic rigor.

## What I Already Have (Do NOT duplicate)
- Thomas Attwood and Birmingham School (comprehensive)
- Harold Heslop (coal miner writer) biographical details
- General outline of curriculum capture, Economist founding, Bank Charter Act 1844
- Colonial hut tax policy documentation
- Distributional consequences data

## Specific Research Needed

### 1. James Wilson - The Economist Founder (HIGH PRIORITY)

**What I need:**
- Biographical details: birth/death dates, occupation before founding magazine, political affiliations
- Specific quotes from early Economist issues (1843-1850) attacking alternative monetary theories
- Documented connections to Currency School economists (Ricardo disciples, Bank of England officials)
- Financial backing sources for the magazine
- Circulation numbers in 1840s-1850s
- Examples of specific articles dismissing Banking School or Birmingham School proposals

**Required format:**
- Full Chicago-style citations for all claims
- Primary sources preferred (actual Economist articles from 1840s)
- Secondary sources must be from peer-reviewed economic history

**Why this matters:**
Need to show The Economist was explicitly founded as Currency School propaganda organ, not neutral journalism.

### 2. University Curriculum Capture - Specific Professors & Textbooks (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**What I need:**
- Names of specific professors at Oxford, Cambridge, or London universities (1820s-1850s) who taught Ricardo's Principles
- Which political economy courses existed and when they were established
- Specific textbook adoptions (which books replaced which in curriculum)
- Student enrollment numbers in political economy courses
- Examples of examination questions showing gold orthodoxy
- Any documented cases of heterodox economists being denied positions

**Specific examples needed:**
- Did Nassau Senior teach at Oxford? When? What texts?
- Did J.S. Mill's Principles (1848) immediately replace earlier texts?
- Which universities taught political economy first?

**Required format:**
- Chicago-style citations for curriculum records, university archives
- Actual examination papers if available
- Contemporary accounts of lectures/pedagogy

**Why this matters:**
Need concrete examples showing HOW curriculum was captured, not just assertion that it happened.

### 3. Bank Charter Act 1844 Parliamentary Debate - Specific Quotes (LOW PRIORITY)

**What I need:**
- Hansard records of parliamentary debates on the Act
- Specific quotes from Robert Peel explaining his reasoning
- Quotes from opponents (Banking School advocates) showing their arguments
- Vote counts and party affiliations of supporters/opponents
- Any discussion of alternatives proposed and rejected

**Specific questions:**
- Did anyone in Parliament cite Adam Smith's 1776 tax-money passage?
- Did anyone reference the Bank Restriction period (1797-1821) as evidence paper money could work?
- What arguments did Peel use to dismiss Banking School concerns?

**Required format:**
- Full Hansard citations with dates, volume numbers, column numbers
- Chicago Manual of Style format for parliamentary documents

**Why this matters:**
Need to show that chartalist understanding was literally unspeakable in Parliament by 1844.

---

### 4. Colonial Hut Tax - Documented Individual Victim (LOW-MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**What I need:**
- Named individual from Kenya (1901 Hut Tax), Bambatha Rebellion (1905), or Hut Tax War Sierra Leone (1898)
- Biographical details: name, village, family situation
- Specific documented experience: amount owed, how paid, consequences of non-payment
- Contemporary testimony if available (trial records, missionary accounts, colonial documents)

**Specific examples to investigate:**
- Bambatha kaMancinza himself (rebellion leader) - is there documentation of his personal hut tax burden?
- Any named individuals from Hut Tax War Commission reports?
- Missionary records documenting specific families' experiences?

**Required format:**
- Chicago-style citations from archival sources
- Transparency about any gaps in documentation
- NO fictional composite characters - real documented individuals only

**Why this matters:**
Chapter 9 already discusses hut tax policy broadly. A specific documented individual would add human dimension to the analytical chapter.

## Research Standards Required

### Citation Format
All sources MUST use Chicago Manual of Style 17th edition:

**Books:**
Author Last Name, First Name. *Title in Italics*. Place of Publication: Publisher, Year.

**Journal Articles:**
Author Last Name, First Name. "Article Title in Quotes." *Journal Name in Italics* Volume, no. Issue (Year): Page Range.

**Archival Sources:**
Repository Name, Collection Name, Box/Folder/Item Number, "Document Title," Date.

**Hansard:**
Parliament. *Hansard*. Series, vol., col. (Date). URL if available.

### Source Hierarchy (Priority Order)
1. **Primary sources** (1820s-1850s documents, speeches, letters, articles)
2. **Peer-reviewed economic history** (journal articles from reputable economics/history journals)
3. **University press monographs** (Cambridge, Oxford, MIT, Chicago, etc.)
4. **Reputable trade press** (only if primary/secondary sources unavailable)

### What NOT to Include
- Wikipedia (may consult for leads but never cite)
- Undergraduate textbooks
- Blog posts or non-peer-reviewed websites
- Any source without clear authorship and publication details
- Fictional or composite characters

### Evidence Standards
- Every factual claim needs a citation
- Biographical details (birth/death dates, positions held) require documented sources
- Quotes must include page numbers and exact citations
- If documentation is incomplete, explicitly note gaps: "Available sources do not document X"

## Deliverable Format

For each section above, provide:

### 1. Summary Paragraph
Brief overview of findings with 2-3 key facts

### 2. Detailed Findings
- Organized by subtopic
- Each claim followed immediately by Chicago-style citation in footnote format
- Direct quotes in quotation marks with page numbers

### 3. Source List
Complete bibliography in Chicago format of all sources consulted

### 4. Gaps & Limitations
Explicit documentation of what could NOT be found, what remains uncertain, what would require archive visits
