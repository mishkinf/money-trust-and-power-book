# When the King Defaulted: Goldsmith Banking 1640-1672

On January 2, 1672, Charles II suspended repayment of £1.3 million in Crown debts, destroying England's first banking system in a single stroke. The Stop of the Exchequer bankrupted five major goldsmith-bankers including Edward Backwell (owed £295,994) and Robert Vyner (owed over £400,000), financially ruined over 10,000 depositor families, and froze London's commercial credit within days. Yet this catastrophe also catalyzed the 1694 founding of the Bank of England and established the constitutional principle that sovereign debt requires institutional frameworks beyond the personal finances of private bankers. The crisis reveals how financial innovation without institutional safeguards creates systemic vulnerability—and how Restoration London's goldsmith shops on Lombard Street functioned as England's proto-banks, complete with checking accounts, banknotes, and fractional reserves decades before the Bank of England existed.

This investigation uncovers extensive primary source documentation—from Pepys' diary entries recording depositing "thousands of crusados" at Backwell's shop to Treasury minute books showing desperate negotiations five days after the Stop—while revealing a critical gap: the voices of ordinary depositors remain largely silent in historical records, their devastation documented in aggregate statistics rather than personal testimony.

## The Lombard Street banking quarter

Lombard Street stretched 260 meters from Bank junction to Gracechurch Street through London's financial heart. The eastern section retained its medieval narrowness while the western portion widened near St Mary Woolnoth church, lined with "good and lofty buildings" housing goldsmith-bankers whose hanging signs—The Unicorn (Edward Backwell), The Grasshopper (Thomas Gresham), The Vine (Thomas and Robert Vyner)—served as landmarks in an era when literacy was limited. Strype's 1720 account describes it as "throughout graced with good and lofty buildings, among which are many that surpass those in other streets, and generally it is inhabited by goldsmiths, bankers, merchants, and other eminent tradesmen."

Inside these establishments, the ground-floor shop featured large arched windows with horizontal shutters that lowered at night for security, the lower shutter folding down to form a counter where customers stood outside while the shopkeeper served from within. Samuel Pepys observed this configuration firsthand on June 17, 1662, when he found "his lady going to take coach stood in the shop" at Backwell's, where a Portuguese merchant offered her "a gilded glassfull of perfumed comfits"—revealing shops as social spaces where even the banker's wife might greet clients amid luxurious details like gilt vessels and imported delicacies.

**Confidence: Definitive** [Pepys, Diary, June 17, 1662, Wikisource edition]

The goldsmith shops extended deep into buildings with living quarters above or behind, and critically, secure vaults below or in back rooms. From the 1640s onward, goldsmiths offered "safe custody of customers' valuables in their well-fortified vaults"—infrastructure originally developed for their metalworking trade that became essential banking infrastructure after Charles I's 1640 seizure of £200,000 in private gold deposited in the Tower of London drove the wealthy to seek alternative storage.

By 1669, Backwell's prosperity was evident when he showed Pepys "the model of his houses that he is going to build in Cornhill and Lumbard Street; but he hath purchased so much there, that it looks like a little town, and must have cost him a great deal of money." By December 1670, Backwell had obtained a 51-year lease of 6,576 square feet of ground and enlarged his own house from 13 to 21 hearths—a substantial expansion reflecting the scale of banking operations just two years before the Stop destroyed his business.

The Great Fire of September 1666 devastated Lombard Street. By 10:00 a.m. on Monday, September 3, the fire reached "the wealthiest part of the City, the area around Lombard Street and Gracechurch Street," and by 4:00 p.m., "the financial centre of the city (and home to many of England's wealthiest men) succumbed to the fire." Thomas Vincent wrote that "the houses tumble, tumble, tumble with a great crash, leaving the foundations open to the view of the Heavens." Pepys witnessed bankers rushing to save assets: "Among others I now saw my little goldsmith, Stokes, receiving some friend's goods, whose house itself was burned the day after." Robert Vyner "had just enough time to collect his papers, detailing the vast debt owed to him by the crown, and plate."

## How goldsmith banking actually worked

**The deposit transaction:** When a customer brought gold or silver to a goldsmith-banker like Edward Backwell, the goldsmith issued a written receipt showing the depositor's name, amount deposited, and terms—either "sight payable" (on demand) or requiring "a weekes warning" for withdrawal. The goldsmith paid **6% annual interest** on deposits and recorded the transaction in leather-bound ledgers using double-entry bookkeeping maintained by scribal clerks in quill pen on handmade paper.

**Confidence: Definitive** [Kim, Jongchul, "How Modern Banking Originated," Business History 53:6 (2011): 939-959; NatWest Group Heritage Hub]

Backwell's surviving 1671-72 customer ledger contains 666 folios detailing 400 customers' accounts, including entries for "the King's Most Excellent Majestie," Prince Rupert, the Prince of Orange, the Earl of Sandwich, the Countess of Castlemaine, Samuel Pepys, 19 other goldsmith-bankers' clearing accounts, the East India Company, and "hundreds of English and foreign merchants" along with "relatively humble doctors, lawyers, and military officers." The Little London Directory of 1677 lists approximately 1,800 merchants, "a significant proportion" of whom held Backwell accounts.

**Confidence: Definitive** [NatWest Group Heritage Hub; Archives Hub GB1502-EB]

**Making payments:** Depositors could make payments through three mechanisms. First, goldsmith receipts became negotiable instruments that could be endorsed and transferred like bills of exchange—by 1660, these evolved into early banknotes commonly issued in £1 and £5 denominations. The expression "good as gold" originated from these receipts' reliability. Second, depositors wrote "drawn notes" (early checks)—letters authorizing their goldsmith to pay a creditor, who presented the note for cash payment. Third, when both parties banked with the same goldsmith, payments were made by ledger transfer with no physical money changing hands.

**Confidence: Definitive** [Quinn, Stephen, "Goldsmith-Banking: Mutual Acceptance and Interbanker Clearing," Explorations in Economic History 34:4 (1997): 411-432]

**Fractional reserve discovery:** Goldsmiths discovered deposited gold was rarely withdrawn—typical cash balances fluctuated by only 1/36th of total deposits day-to-day, allowing bankers to retain approximately 1/10th of deposits as reserves while lending the remainder. This created credit "out of thin air" through the banking network. Crucially, 19 goldsmith-bankers maintained clearing accounts with Edward Backwell, working together to clear each other's banknotes and drawn notes at par value. This mutual acceptance of competitors' notes enhanced the viability of all bank debt as payment and provided mutual support during crises—until the Stop overwhelmed this informal network.

**Confidence: Definitive for fractional reserves; Definitive for 19 clearing accounts** [Quinn PhD thesis, 1994; Backwell ledgers]

**Revenue model:** Goldsmiths earned **8-10% or more** by purchasing Crown debt (Exchequer orders on future tax revenues) at a discount, despite the 6% legal usury cap—exploiting the arbitrage while paying depositors 6% interest. Backwell advanced money against future revenues, accumulating £365,000 in royal debt by 1670.

## Named depositors beyond Pepys and Charles II

Beyond Samuel Pepys (Backwell's most frequently mentioned client in his diary, referenced nearly 60 times) and King Charles II, specific documented depositors include:

**Duke of Albemarle (George Monck)**: Received £500 from Excise Office via his secretary Matthew Lock on August 18, 1660, documented in Backwell's ledger acquittances.
**Confidence: Definitive** [Bonhams Auction Catalog, June 26, 2019, Lot 4]

The **East India Company** was a major corporate client, along with multiple City livery companies and ship-owning consortia.
**Confidence: Definitive** [Backwell ledgers]

## The crisis: January 2-31, 1672

**Tuesday, January 2, 1672**: Charles II suddenly and unexpectedly suspends all Exchequer payments "upon any warrant, securities or orders, whether registered or not registered therein" excepting only orders on subsidies per Act of Parliament and fee farm rents. Total outstanding obligations: £1,211,065 (later recalculated as £1,328,526 by 1677). The Crown promises 6% annual interest but no principal repayment for one year.

**Confidence: Definitive** [London Gazette No. 641, January 4, 1672; Calendar of Treasury Books Vol. 3, ed. William A. Shaw, 1908, pp. 1005-1026]

**Friday, January 5, 1672**: Treasury minute book records that "His Royal Highness [Duke of York], Prince Rupert, the Lord Keeper, Duke of Monmouth, Duke of Buckingham, Duke of Ormonde, Earl of Lauderdale, Lord Arlington, Lord Ashley, Treasurer of the Household, Secretary Trevor, Sir John Duncombe, Sir R. Long, Sir Robt. Viner, Alderman Backwell, Mr. Meynell, Mr. Lyndsy, Mr. Snow, Mr. Portman, and other bankers concerned are to attend at the Treasury on Sunday, 7th of January, at four in the afternoon"—emergency negotiations just five days after the announcement.

**Confidence: Definitive** [Calendar of Treasury Books Vol. 3, January 5, 1672, p. 1006]

**Saturday, January 6, 1672**: Richard Langhorne writes to Lord Hatton: "I believe it certain that the trade of bankers is totally destroyed by this accident." He explains 82 ships are being prepared for the Third Dutch War, Lombard Street bankers refused additional Crown loans, and the King diverted bond repayment funds to naval preparations. The commercial credit freeze begins within days.

**Confidence: Definitive** [Langhorne to Hatton, Hatton Correspondence, Camden Society Vol. 1, 1878, p. 101]

**Friday, January 12, 1672**: Treasury minute: "Alderman Backwell, Mr. Snow and Mr. Portman called in. They desire interest every three months. My Lords will ask the King's pleasure in it... They move that they may have assistance from the King against arrests. My Lords say they must consult and prepare what may be done. [Ordered] that Auditor Aldworth take the accounts of such debts as are owing by his Majesty to them and other bankers."

**Confidence: Definitive** [Calendar of Treasury Books Vol. 3, January 12, 1672, p. 1008]

**Friday, January 19, 1672**: "An order to be drawn to vacate the great seal which constituted Mr. Alderman Backwell receiver of the Queen's portion in Portugal"—the Crown strips Backwell of his Portuguese revenue collection role, eliminating a crucial income stream.

**Confidence: Definitive** [Calendar of Treasury Books Vol. 3, January 19, 1672, p. 1012]

The system collapse was **immediate** (credit markets froze within days, bank runs began within weeks) yet **prolonged** (formal bankruptcies took 10+ years, final debt settlement took 34 years to 1706).

**Confidence: Definitive** [Multiple sources]

## Cascade effects: documented bankruptcies

**Five confirmed major goldsmith-banker failures** among government creditors:

**Edward Backwell** (c.1618-1683): Owed £295,994 by 1677 (22% of total debt), annual interest loss £17,759. Operated 1651-1682 from "The Unicorn," Lombard Street. Declared bankruptcy 1682 after 10 years of struggling to meet depositor demands. Died June 13, 1683. An Act of Parliament was required in 1698—15 years after his death—to settle his bankruptcy estate, which took 26 years total to unwind. His depositors received partial recovery at best.

**Confidence: Definitive** [Archives Hub GB1502-EB; Calendar of Treasury Books; Pepys Diary Encyclopedia]

**Sir Robert Vyner** (1631-1688): Owed over £400,000 (the largest single creditor). King's goldsmith who made Charles II's coronation regalia (£12,184 bill). Sheriff 1666-67 during Great Fire, Lord Mayor 1674-75. Declared bankrupt 1683-84. Act of Parliament passed 1698 for "relief of the Creditors of Sir Robert Vyner." His will ordered estate sale to pay creditors 30% of principal with balance charged against government excise grant. Died September 2, 1688, "broken-hearted at the death of his only son."

**Confidence: Definitive for amounts and dates** [Wikipedia - Robert Vyner; National Portrait Gallery archives; Parliamentary records]

**Three additional unnamed goldsmith-bankers** failed among the government creditors; their identities remain undocumented in accessible sources. **Nine additional goldsmith-banking houses** were "seriously undermined" but survived.

**Confidence: Definitive for count; Probable for unnamed identities** [Multiple scholarly sources]

## Recovery rates: thirty-four years of broken promises

**1672-1675**: Zero payments. No interest, no principal. The one-year suspension extended indefinitely.

**March 1675**: First interest payments begin—three years late.

**1680-1685**: Only **56% of expected payments** actually made.

**1685-1688** (James II): Payment rate collapses to **21% of expected amount**.

**1688-1701**: Payments "dried up altogether" after William and Mary reallocated hereditary excise revenues to the Nine Years' War.

**Confidence: Definitive** [Wikipedia - Stop of the Exchequer citing Shaw, Calendar of Treasury Books; Li, Ling-Fan, "Stop of the Exchequer and Secondary Market," Journal of Economic History 79:1 (2019): 176-200]

**The legal battle** consumed decades. Court of Exchequer ruled for bankers in 1692 (20 years after Stop). Court of Exchequer Chamber reversed in 1696 under Lord Somers "on technical grounds which left a general feeling that an injustice had been done." House of Lords ruled for bankers in January 1700—but Parliament allocated all hereditary excise revenues to current spending, rendering the judgment meaningless.

**Confidence: Definitive** [Multiple sources]

**1701 settlement (Appropriation of Revenue Act 1700)**: Interest rate reduced from 6% to **3%**. Payments only from December 1705 forward. Based on 1676 principal only (£1,328,526). **All missed interest 1680-1704 never compensated**. Effectively, principal recognized at **50% of original value**.

**1716**: National Debt Act reduced rate further to **2.5%**.

**Effective investment return over 34 years: 0.01%** (scholarly calculation by Milevsky).

**Confidence: Definitive for Parliamentary acts; Scholarly calculation for effective return** [Li, 2019; Milevsky, The Day the King Defaulted, 2017]

## The ordinary depositors: missing voices

A critical gap exists in the historical record: **no documented case studies of named non-elite depositors with personal testimony** have been located in accessible sources. While we know "over 10,000 wealthy families were financially embarrassed," "houses were lost," "ordinary investors suffered," and "many bankers spent the end of their lives in debtors' prison" (Milevsky, 2017), their individual voices were not preserved.

**Confidence: Probable for aggregate statistics; Gap confirmed for individual narratives** [Milevsky, 2017; Multiple scholarly sources]

**Why this gap exists:** 17th-century record-keeping prioritized elite figures and institutions. Ordinary depositors had no direct legal claim against the Crown—only against their bankrupt bankers. Literacy rates limited personal documentation. Working and middle-class papers were rarely preserved. Individual bankruptcy proceedings weren't publicized as personal stories.

**The closest documented case: Samuel Pepys**, though a government official rather than truly "ordinary," best represents affected depositors. His diary (ending 1669, three years before the Stop) shows extensive banking with Backwell. On July 23, 1666, Pepys wrote of Backwell: "he says he has a good master, the King, who will not suffer him to be undone, as otherwise he must have been, and I believe him"—tragically ironic given the King's 1672 default.

**Confidence: Definitive for Pepys' banking relationship** [Pepys, Diary, July 23, 1666]

**Reconstructed scenario** (evidence-based but individual details inferred): A textile merchant deposits £500 in gold with Backwell in 1671. January 2, 1672: Hears of the Stop, attempts withdrawal, but Backwell cannot pay—his assets frozen in Exchequer. 1672-1675: Business suffers with capital locked up; forced to borrow at high rates; other creditors demand payment. 1675-1682: Occasional small payments (perhaps £50-100 over decade). 1682: Backwell declares bankruptcy; merchant becomes creditor in bankruptcy. 1683-1698: Backwell dies; bankruptcy estate managed by executors. 1698: Act of Parliament settles estate; merchant receives perhaps 25-40% of original deposit (£125-200 of £500). **Total elapsed time: 26 years**.

**Confidence: Inferred from documented aggregate outcomes and timeline**

## Institutional aftermath: birth of the Bank of England

Gilbert Burnet wrote that "the bankers were broken, and multitudes who had put their money in their hands were ruined by this dishonourable and perfidious action." Charles II himself reportedly called it a "false step."

**Confidence: Definitive** [Burnet, History of His Own Time, 1724]

The Stop destroyed the "cosy relationship" between Crown and private bankers. In 1694—22 years after the crisis—Parliament chartered the Bank of England with a £1.2 million loan to government at **8% interest** plus £4,000 annual service charge. The Bank's founding established the principle that sovereign debt requires institutional frameworks separating public borrowing from private banking. "From now on, the British government would never fail to repay its creditors."

**Confidence: Definitive** [Bank of England official history; multiple scholarly sources]

New goldsmith-bankers emerged after 1672 who "avoided making loans to the State, and spread their investments more wisely." Richard Hoare founded C. Hoare & Co. in July 1672—notably just months after the Stop—learning from the disaster. His bank survives to the present as Britain's oldest continuously operating family-owned bank.

## Usable quotes from primary sources

**Samuel Pepys diary entries:**

"Up and abroad to the goldsmiths, to see what money I could get upon my present tallys upon the advance of the Excise, and I hope I shall get L10,000. I went also and had them entered at the Excise Office. Alderman Backewell is at sea. Sir R. Viner come to towne but this morning." [July 1665]

"As soon as up I among my goldsmiths, Sir Robert Viner and Colvill, and there got L10,000 of my new tallys accepted...got near L5000 more accepted, and so from this day the whole, or near, L15,000, lies upon interest." [July 1665]

"Home to dinner, where I found Mr. Moore, and he and I cast up our accounts together and evened them, and then with the last chest of crusados to Alderman Backwell's, by the same token his lady going to take coach stood in the shop, and having a gilded glassfull of perfumed comfits given her by Don Duarte de Silva, the Portugall merchant, that is come over with the Queen, I did offer at a taste, and so she poured some out into my hand." [June 17, 1662]

"To dinner, and found Dr. Thos. Pepys at my house; but I was called from dinner by a note from Mr. Moore to Alderman Backwell's, to see some thousands of my Lord's crusados weighed, and we find that 3,000 come to about 530l. or 40 generally." [June 17, 1662]

"[Backwell] showed me the model of his houses that he is going to build in Cornhill and Lumbard Street; but he hath purchased so much there, that it looks like a little town, and must have cost him a great deal of money." [April 12, 1669]

"[Pepys] discoursed with [Backwell] about the remitting of this £6,000 to Tangier...and he with some vain glory told me that the business of Sherenesse [Medway crisis] did make him quite mad, and indeed might well have undone him." [November 15, 1667]

**Contemporary pamphlet (1676), "The Mystery of the New-Fashioned Goldsmiths or Bankers Discovered" by "J.R.":**

"I have given you my Remarques upon the Rise and growth of these new kind of Goldsmiths, and I take them to have been in their highest Ascendant or State about the time that our Ships were burnt at Chatham by the Dutch: that cold Storm of the Peoples fears that their money was not safe in the Bankers hands blighted them, and since being in their declension, the Famous stop upon the Exchequer almost blasted their very root, men being unwilling to trust money in their hands to lend his Majesty, so long as they hear the deplorable Cryes of the Widdow and the Fatherless, whose money they say at Feasts, they lent the King, and cannot repay them, no not their Intrest to buy them Bread."

"The deposit system may be said to have originated about the time of the civil war. After Charles I in 1640 seized 200,000l. which, according to the custom of the period, was lodged for safety in the Tower, it gradually became a habit to lodge money with the goldsmiths."

"Besides the rents of the country gentlemen, the goldsmiths received clandestinely from servants the money of their masters, which was lent them at the rate of 4d. per cent, per day."

**Richard Langhorne to Lord Hatton, January 6, 1672 (four days after Stop):**

"I believe it certain that the trade of bankers is totally destroyed by this accident." [Camden Society, Hatton's Correspondence, Vol. 1, 1878, p. 101]

This investigation reveals goldsmith banking's sophistication—fractional reserves, checking accounts, banknotes, interbank clearing—decades before institutional safeguards existed. The Stop of the Exchequer stands as England's first modern financial crisis, demonstrating how innovation without institutional frameworks creates systemic vulnerability. Yet from catastrophe emerged the constitutional principle that sovereign debt requires separation from private banking—a principle embodied in the 1694 Bank of England charter that established credible commitment to repayment. The voices of ordinary depositors remain tragically silent in surviving records, their individual devastation documented only in aggregate statistics and the bitter contemporary complaint about "the deplorable Cryes of the Widdow and the Fatherless."
