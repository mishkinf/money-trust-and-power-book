Money Through the Ages: From Barter to Bretton
Woods and Beyond
Early forms of money and credit. In human prehistory people bartered goods like livestock and grain, but
trade also used commodity “money”: items of intrinsic value such as cowrie shells, salt, or beads often
served as common media of exchange 1 . Societies also kept accounts of debt: for example, ancient
Mesopotamian tablets and even carved tally sticks recorded who owed what. One scholar notes that
counting tools and records (e.g. 20,000‑year‑old tally bones) show “money of account predates the use of
coinage by several thousand years” 2 . In other words, early money often began as promises or credits on
a ledger, then later took physical form (coins, paper) once societies developed standardized units.
Medieval trade and banking innovations. By the High Middle Ages, long-distance trade demanded safer
and more convenient payment methods. Italian banking families (sometimes called “Lombards”) pioneered
bills of exchange and letters of credit, letting merchants send payment orders instead of carrying heavy
coin 3 . At the same time, Italy’s city-states competed fiercely in coinage. Florence and Venice succeeded
by maintaining stable gold coins. For example, Florence’s gold florin (first minted 1252) weighed about 3.5
grams of nearly pure gold and was never debased for centuries 4 . Likewise the Venetian ducat (1284)
kept an unchanging gold standard 5 . These cities resisted debasement, gaining reputations for “honesty
and stability,” so their coins were trusted far beyond Italy

dominated medieval international trade because they kept reliable weight and purity 4 6 .
Merchants across Europe and the Mediterranean preferred these “good money.” By the 1300s the florin was
widely accepted in Flanders, Germany, England and the Levant; contracts often specified payment in florins,
and major banking houses (Bardi, Peruzzi, Medici, etc.) built credit networks around it 4 7 . In contrast,
states that repeatedly debased their coins (like some popes or Naples) found their money shunned outside
local borders. Thus medieval markets “chose” money by trust: stable coins spread by market competition.
Italian innovations – bills of exchange – also facilitated trade by allowing payments without moving gold. A
13th-century merchant could effectively lend or pay another by endorsing a bill of exchange, which banks
could honor in distant cities 3 . Such credit instruments marked an early domestic “money” of account for
merchants, parallel to physical coin.

England’s Financial Revolution (1688–1760)
By the 17th century, European monarchs faced rising war costs they could no longer fund through simple
taxes. In England, a turning point came with the Glorious Revolution (1688), which placed William III and
Mary II on the throne under a strengthened Parliament. Parliament asserted control over royal finances: it
forbade the Crown from borrowing without its consent and set up accounting oversight (a 1690 Public
Accounts Commission, etc.) 8 . Historians call this the “Financial Revolution.” The old royal debts (often
personal loans at exorbitant interest) were converted into a funded public debt under parliamentary control

9 . One scholar notes that after 1688 “personal royal debt [was] transferred…into a public debt controlled
by Parliament” 9 .

In 1694, amid William’s expensive wars with France, Parliament authorized creation of the Bank of England
as a joint‐stock company to lend money to the government. The Bank’s first loan (£1.2 million at 8 %)
financed war efforts 10 . Equally important was Parliament’s guarantee: new taxes were explicitly
earmarked to service the Bank’s debt 11 . Investors in the Bank thus knew their loans were as secure as
government taxes. As the UK Parliament’s history notes, this assurance “helped ensure the success” of the
Bank – loaners “could be confident that their loans…would be repaid by parliamentary taxation
appropriated for that purpose” 11 . In effect, England pioneered the modern funded state bond. The
Crown’s discretionary debt became a public obligation backed by taxes.

and in 1694 it sponsored a new Bank to loan William III’s government £1.2 million 10 – with taxes dedicated to
paying it back 11 .
By 1696 Parliament also reformed coinage. Appointing Isaac Newton as Master of the Mint, it undertook a
great recoinage and fixed a new gold/silver ratio. In 1717 Newton set the mint price of gold relative to silver
too low for silver’s market value, inadvertently placing Britain on a gold standard 12 . Silver coins then
flowed out of Britain, and gold became the de facto anchor of the pound. Over the 18th century Britain
remained on this de facto gold standard (with legal statutes in place by 1774) 12 . In summary, England’s
17th–18th century finance featured parliamentary oversight, a national bank, government bonds, and a
shift to gold – all driven by war needs and political reform 9 11 .

War Finance and the Gold Standard (1790–1914)
The Napoleonic wars turned these principles to extremes. In Britain, the strain of wartime borrowing led to
inflation and fear of bank runs. In 1797 (during the French invasion scare), Parliament suspended the Bank
of England’s obligation to redeem notes in gold. A massive run on gold would have bankrupted the Bank
(notes outstanding were double the gold reserves 13 ), so Parliament passed the Bank Restriction Act
forbidding gold withdrawals 13 . This “Restriction” (1797–1821) freed the government to issue more paper
currency. By the war’s end in 1814, notes in circulation totaled £28.4 million but were backed by only
£2.2 million of gold 14 . (For reference, just before the suspension the Bank had only £5.3 million bullion
against £10.8 million in notes 13 .) With the war over, Britain eventually restored gold convertibility in 1821,
reviving the prewar currency link.
Across the Channel, revolutionary France also turned to paper money. In 1789 the Assembly printed the
assignat, initially as a 5 % bond backed by confiscated church lands. By 1790 it became redeemable paper
currency, and issuance swelled – from 400 million to 1,200 million livres in one year 15 . At first this relieved
the cash shortage, but popular distrust grew. As war spread in 1792, confidence collapsed and the assignat
hyperinflated. By 1796 it was replaced by mandats territoriaux at a 30:1 ratio, and finally abandoned in
1797; France reverted to a metallic money by Napoleon’s decimal coinage 15 16 . Like Britain’s later
restriction, the French experience shows how unbacked paper in wartime can finance spending at the cost
of trust and price stability.

After Napoleon, Europe largely returned to gold. Britain resumed gold convertibility at the pre-1797 parity
in 1821. Other powers (France, Germany, U.S., etc.) gradually pegged their currency units to specified
quantities of gold (or maintained bimetallic systems) through the 19th century. The classical gold standard
(roughly 1870–1914) tied domestic money to gold and established fixed exchange rates internationally 17 .
Under gold, trade imbalances automatically self-corrected via specie flows, and government debt had to be
funded by either taxes or bond issues with bullion backing. In practice, the 19th century saw governments
issue long-term bonds to finance wars and investments (e.g. railways, military) rather than sudden large tax
hikes. Taxes on trade and consumption helped service these debts, and strong countries (like Britain) built
reputations for honoring debt, keeping interest rates relatively low. Scholars note that sovereign bonds
became liquid collateral; European city-states by the 17th–18th centuries could borrow at ~5% interest, far
below earlier levels, because credit was backed by tax streams 18 . Yet war remained the central driver: with
hundreds of small states competing, “war was frequent… Sovereign debt thus developed as a vital means of
state survival. It enabled the state to finance expenditures of uncertain size and duration” 18 .

Global Monetary Systems: 20th Century to Today
The 20th century brought upheaval. World War I forced most belligerents off gold (governments turned to
printing money and borrowing). In the 1920s a weakened gold standard partially returned, but the Great
Depression broke it again. After World War II, Allied nations redesigned the system at Bretton Woods
(1944). They fixed exchange rates: each currency was pegged to the U.S. dollar (within ±1%), and the dollar
was pegged to gold at $35 per troy ounce 19 . The U.S. Federal Reserve managed this link: dollars held by
foreign central banks were supposed to be redeemable for gold at the official price.
In 1945 the IMF was created to enforce this system. By 1958 currencies were fully convertible again, with
the dollar “reserve currency.” Under Bretton Woods, international balances were settled in dollars, and only
the U.S. owed gold. This arrangement lasted until U.S. deficits and overseas dollar accumulation exceeded
U.S. gold reserves. In 1971 President Nixon formally ended dollar‑gold convertibility 20 . Technically that
dismantled Bretton Woods: by 1973 most major currencies floated in value. Thus, since the early 1970s all
major economies have fiat money – currency backed by government decree and promise, not by a
commodity. Even so, many central banks still hold gold in reserve, partly as a hedge.
Today there is no global commodity money. Exchange rates float (or are loosely managed) and global trade
balances are settled in strong national currencies (e.g. U.S. dollar, euro, yen). Trust in money now hinges on
institutions: central banks, legal systems, and tax laws. As Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) notes, a
sovereign government issues the only currency it can legally accept in taxes, which creates demand for it. In
other words, citizens must use the domestic currency to pay taxes and debts, so that currency is inherently
backed by the state’s taxing power. Internationally, though, major currencies are used by others because of
size and stability of their issuing countries, not by any apolitical virtue. (Cryptocurrencies are a recent
experiment in alternative money, but historically the largest and most liquid currencies have been state‐
sponsored or commodity‐linked.) The history of money shows it is deeply political: regimes issue and honor
currencies for practical (often military) reasons, and trust in money ultimately depends on institutions and
perceived stability, not mythology.
In summary, over the ages money has shifted between various forms – tangible commodity, representative
paper, fiat credit – as societies evolved. Early on, trust was anchored in precious metals or stable
institutions; nations used gold/silver when possible for international trade. In crises (wars, revolutions) they
often resorted to paper and bonds, sometimes creating new banks or currencies (England 1694, US

3

Continental dollars, French assignats, etc.). By the late 19th and early 20th centuries many countries
standardized on the gold standard to facilitate trade. After WWII, fixed exchange rates tied to the U.S. dollar
(and dollar to gold) aimed for stability, until finally in 1971 the fully fiat era began. Through it all, the choice
of money (commodity vs credit, hard vs soft) reflected fiscal needs, political power, and what people would
accept as trust-worthy medium. The key lesson is historical: money is social and political, always emerging
from the needs and agreements of its time 11 9 .
