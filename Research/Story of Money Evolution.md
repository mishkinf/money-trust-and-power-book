From Tally Sticks to Fiat: The Story of Money’s
Evolution
Long before coins or banknotes, societies kept debt and payments on clay tablets, temple ledgers or
notched sticks – in effect, credit money. For example, medieval England’s royal treasury used tally sticks
(split hazel-wood rods) to record tax payments and debts. Each stick was notched with the amount, then
split: the collector kept one half, the Exchequer the other. As one historian notes, these sticks “were an
interest-free IOU (a promise to pay coin)… fully transferable and acceptable as a means to pay taxes. …As
such they had currency as money” 1 . In other words, the state’s tax liabilities themselves circulated like
money. Similar practices were found in ancient temples and local communities – a priest or chief would
write debts in an account book, effectively running an informal bank. What we call “money” began simply as
a way to track who owed what.
By the late Middle Ages, expanding trade pushed Europeans to innovate. Carrying precious metals overseas
was costly and risky, so merchant bankers (often Italians from Lombardy, or Jewish and Florentine
financiers) created bills of exchange: written orders to pay a sum in a distant city. One merchant might
deposit silver in Venice and receive a bill payable to another merchant in London. That second merchant
could sell (or endorse) the bill to pay someone else in pounds. In effect, a bill of exchange combined an
international remittance with a loan. It let traders settle foreign purchases without moving coin. These bills
were negotiable – they could be sold or discounted at money markets – and they tied together currencies
and credit across borders. For example, a Paris merchant sending silk to London could get paid in francs via
a French bill drawn on a London banker. As trade grew, major banks in places like Venice, Genoa or Antwerp
handled huge volumes of such bills, enabling long-distance commerce. In practice:
• A merchant in City A would sell goods or lend funds to a local banker and receive a draft drawn on a
partner banker in City B.
• The merchant gave this bill to his creditor (who might live in City B), effectively transferring the right
to claim payment in City B’s currency.
• The banker in City B, upon presentation of the bill, paid the creditor in local coin.
This system functioned as an early foreign-exchange market. Even kings used it – for instance, the Medicis
in France and Spain loaned to monarchs via these bills. But it required trust: if the issuer or guarantor was
seen as unreliable, a bill might be refused or at a steep discount. Hence one sees in history that rulers who
defaulted on debt (like Charles I of England or some medieval city-states) found financing cut off.
The real pivot came in 1688–1694 in England. The Glorious Revolution established parliamentary control of
the purse. King William III needed massive funds to fight Louis XIV, but Parliament now insisted on
supervising taxes and spending. Historians note that after 1688 “Parliament held the purse strings and
repayment was guaranteed, so loans flowed and property rights became more secure” 2 . William’s Nine
Years’ War (1688–97) cost about £5½ million a year at first, rising to £8½ million by war’s end 3 . Parliament
passed new excise and land taxes – though burdensome, they were seen as legitimate because MPs voted
them. A Commons Commission even required each supply bill to specify precisely how revenues were spent
4 . In short, the state could now credibly promise to use tax income to repay debts. As a contemporary

1

account puts it, this “increased parliamentary control of revenue helped to ensure the success of the Bank
of England… for investors in the Bank could be confident that their loans to the Government would be
repaid by parliamentary taxation appropriated for that purpose” 5 .
In this climate of fiscal reform, England created the Bank of England in 1694. Facing William III’s deficits,
the government offered a loan of £1.2 million from the public at 8% interest. In return, it granted a royal
charter: “The Governor and Company of the Bank of England” was born. The response was astonishingly brisk
– the entire sum was subscribed in just 11 days by over 1,200 individuals from nobles to shopkeepers 6 .
These subscribers effectively became shareholders, lending to the Crown via the Bank. The Crown promised
to use tax revenues (now controlled by Parliament) to pay interest. With this backing, Bank of England notes
(promising gold on demand) and government bonds were now seen as secure. The new bank’s
establishment meant Britain could finance wars by issuing government debt that foreign merchants and
states trusted.
Two decades later, in 1717, England took another step that shaped modern money. Sir Isaac Newton – by
then Warden (and soon Master) of the Royal Mint – recommended adjusting the gold-to-silver ratio of
British currency. At the time one gold guinea coin was legally worth £1 (20 shillings) in silver, but market
rates had diverged. Newton advised raising the guinea to 21 shillings 7 . This slight tweak had massive
consequences: silver became undervalued and flowed out of England, leaving gold coins dominant. In
effect, Newton had “transmuted silver into gold” in the money supply 8 , and Britain slid onto a de facto
gold standard for the next two centuries. From then on the pound was “as sure as the law of gravity,” fixed
by a weight of gold. The decision even inspired awe: novelist Stefan Zweig later wrote that “the Austrian
crown circulated in bright gold pieces, an assurance of its immutability. Everything had its norm, its definite
measure and weight” 9 . Under a gold convertibility promise, anyone holding Bank of England notes or
pounds sterling could demand real gold. This anchor gave creditors confidence: foreign merchants
accepted sterling only because they knew it could be redeemed in gold.

Wars, Credit, and the Need for Hard Money
In the 18th and 19th centuries, wars repeatedly tested this system. Every major European conflict saw
unprecedented spending on arms, navies, and subsidies – often demanding goods from abroad. England in
the Nine Years’ War and the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14) had to import vast quantities of naval
stores, food, and subsidies for allies. Napoleon’s wars (1793–1815) were even more global: for example,
Britain purchased Scandinavian timber for shipbuilding, Russian grain when continental supplies were cut
off, and paid Portugal and Ottoman suppliers in gold. Likewise, France’s wars depleted its treasure –
eventually Napoleon defaulted on some debts. In each case, governments sought loans from bankers and
allied treasuries, often in exchange for hard currency. Foreign creditors demanded payment in gold (or
silver) because fiat notes or war-time scrip were unreliable.
The mechanics of financing such wars often involved the international credit system built on bills of
exchange and sovereign bonds. Governments issued bonds to investors at home and abroad, promising to
pay interest from future taxes. They sometimes sold bills of exchange on major financial centers: a British
agent might draw on Amsterdam, or a French one on Genoa, to raise specie. When taxes flowed, officials
redeemed the promises in coin. For example, in the early 1800s the British Exchequer accepted land and
window taxes as security for debt interest, assuring lenders that “public revenues” were dedicated to
repayment.

2

In these centuries, international trust hinged on convertibility and credible governance. A merchant would
lend to King George III because Parliament swore the loan would be repaid in gold from customs and excise
taxes. By contrast, investors distrusted absolute monarchs or revolutionary regimes that altered contracts.
As one 18th-century writer noted, in smaller states exchange rates fluctuated wildly unless a bank or
sovereign guaranteed payment in good coin 10 . This was why major powers gradually pledged their paper
money to gold: it signaled stability. The British, especially, insisted on “the gold clause”: foreign holders of
pounds could exchange them for bullion at the Bank of England.
In practice, redeeming paper for gold meant that if you held a banknote or Treasury note, you could go to
the issuing bank and demand coin. Banks held vaults of bullion for this purpose. (Notably, during the 1793–
1821 Suspension Period, Britain suspended convertibility; after inflation and crisis, convertibility was restored
by Peel’s Act in 1819.) Elsewhere, the single-peg gold standard was less consistent. For instance, France
maintained bimetallic rules longer but later suffered inflation in wars. The key point was that international
payments typically settled in specie: a creditor in Frankfurt or New York would only accept a country’s notes
if those notes were promised in gold.
This pattern continued through the world wars. In World War I, the Entente powers spent trillions on
munitions, ammunition, and food. Unable to pay in their damaged local currencies, France and Britain
bought massive shipments from the neutral United States and other suppliers – paying often in gold or US
dollars (themselves convertible). The Federal Reserve notes that “a large inflow of European gold to pay for
US exports increased the money supply. The Fed was powerless to offset the gold inflow” 11 . In effect,
Allied belligerents sent gold to America to secure guns and supplies. After 1918, this shift left the US dollar
as the new de facto reserve currency: America’s money stayed tied to gold, while many European currencies
had decoupled or inflated.
World War II saw a similar dynamic on an even greater scale. Britain, desperate for food and equipment,
borrowed (often interest-free) from the US; under Lend-Lease and subsequent loans, the UK accumulated
vast dollar debts. The Americans insisted on repayment in dollars convertible to gold, or in cash. In 1946
Britain even secretly shipped gold bars to Washington to secure final settlement of lend-lease. Overseas
lenders – from New York to Moscow – simply would not accept liabilities unless they could be made good in
tangible gold or gold-backed currency. For the US, financing half the war then guaranteeing civilian
spending, the lesson was the value of a gold promise: many believed as J.P. Morgan had quipped in 1912,
“Money is gold, and nothing else.”

Bretton Woods and the Dollar-Gold Alliance
After WWII, policymakers tried to tame these problems with a new system. At the 1944 Bretton Woods
conference, 44 nations agreed to revive fixed rates pegged to gold – but with the US dollar as the anchor.
The Bretton Woods Agreement “established a new international monetary system… in 1944, with gold as the
basis for the U.S. dollar and fixed exchange rates.” 12 . In practice, every participating country defined its
currency by a fixed value of dollars, and by extension a fixed value of gold. The US promised to redeem
dollars for gold at $35 per ounce, and the International Monetary Fund and World Bank were set up to
manage this order. Thus the postwar era replicated the old gold-parity idea – but under American
hegemony. Trust was high: nations had to keep their currencies within 1% of the agreed parity, and any
foreign central bank could in theory demand gold from the U.S. Treasury. This arrangement facilitated a
global boom in trade and reconstruction. It also echoed the 18th-century confidence in Britain’s gold
convertibility – except now it was the dollar offering that promise.

3

However, by the 1960s strains appeared. The costs of Vietnam and domestic spending in the U.S. meant
dollars in circulation far outpaced gold reserves. In August 1971 President Nixon finally broke the link. The
dollar’s “direct convertibility to gold” was halted – a moment dubbed the “Nixon Shock” 13 . As one account
notes, after Nixon “devalued the U.S. dollar relative to gold… he declared a temporary suspension of the
dollar’s convertibility into gold. By 1973, the Bretton Woods system had collapsed” 14 . In effect, no
government could now redeem its bills for bullion. With that, the world moved fully to fiat money: national
currencies backed only by government decree and public confidence. Exchange rates floated freely.

Legacy: From Credit to Fiat
The journey from wooden sticks to electronic bank balances was driven by needs of trade, war and trust.
Throughout history, the same themes recur: credit expands the reach of money, but only if someone
guarantees it. Early temple ledgers and tally sticks show that governments and banks have long issued
“money” as promises to pay. Bills of exchange and banks then linked distant markets, letting commerce
flourish without heavy coin. When nation-states needed funding – especially for wars – they created public
debt secured by taxes and pledges of convertibility. The Glorious Revolution and creation of the Bank of
England were landmark events: by subordinating royal debt to Parliament and pledging tax revenues,
investors believed in the pound as surely as they once believed in warmongering monarchs.
Gold played the role of universal promise. A 20th-century writer captured the faith that metal inspired: “the
gold standard… remained there [for the next 200 years]… successful because… everyone knew where they
stood” 8 . From Newton’s London to postwar Bretton Woods New Hampshire, tying currency to a weight of
gold was meant to instill discipline and trust. Once that link was broken – in 1971 and forever –
governments had no commodity backing their notes, only tax receipts and policies. Today’s fiat currencies
are descendants of all these experiments. The paper bills and digital balances we use trace back to clay and
sticks – always a promise of value. Our modern monetary system grew step by step: from temple scribes
and tally sticks, to bills of exchange on merchant tables, to parliament’s ledgers, to gold coins in vaults, and
finally to the floating fiat that underpins our economy.
