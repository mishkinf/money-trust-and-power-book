1. Bank of England Loan Mechanics (1694-1800s): The Birth of Modern Central Banking
How the Bank created loans to government
The Bank's founding in 1694 established a revolutionary model. Wikipedia The loan and incorporation were simultaneous: investors subscribed £1.2 million, becoming both lenders to
government and shareholders of the new Bank. This wasn't a loan in the modern sense—it was a permanent debt where subscribers received 8% interest in perpetuity but no principal
repayment. econstor
Critical accounting innovation: The £720,000 actually paid in (from phased capital calls—only 25% immediately, 35% later in 1694) was recorded under the "Banknote" heading on the
balance sheet. tontinecoffeehouse As historian William Arthur Shaw noted, "the concept of shareholders equity as an accounting item was not yet in vogue" in 1697.
The transformation to note-issue funding: Within just three years, the funding model fundamentally shifted. By 1697, "banknotes and bills outstanding made up the lion's share of the
Bank's funding sources" (Tontine Coffee-House analysis). This was revolutionary: the Bank could issue non-interest-bearing notes (essentially creating money) to fund interest-bearing
government debt, capturing the spread as seigniorage profit. qmul

The quid pro quo structure
Each charter renewal involved explicit exchange:
1697: Capital increased £1 million; Bank received monopoly clause prohibiting other banks by Act of Parliament
1708: £400,000 interest-free loan; Bank gained prohibition on partnerships >6 persons from issuing notes—creating de facto monopoly on joint-stock banking
1742: £1.6 million interest-free loan; interest on total debt reduced to 3%
1800: £3 million interest-free loan for 6 years
The relationship was symbiotic: government granted monopoly privileges (especially note-issuing), Bank provided favorable permanent loans. econstor ucsd

Rollover mechanism, not closeout
Loans were never closed out. As Bank of England FOI response (2020) confirms: "When the Bank was founded in 1694 it lent £1.2 million to the government. Over the next 140 years the
debt increased and decreased until in 1834 the amount outstanding was £11,015,100...When the Bank was nationalised in 1946 the outstanding balance was still £11,015,100."
Charter renewals extended the debt, renegotiated interest rates (declining from 8% to 3% to 2.5%), but maintained the permanent structure. The government retained the option to repay
after notice (initially August 1, 1705), but never exercised it.

Double-entry bookkeeping
The Bank maintained comprehensive records from 1694 ("complete balance sheets from 1696 onwards" per Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin 1967). Bank of England
approximately 300 clerks maintained detailed asset-liability ledgers—five times more than the Treasury employed. History Today

2. Isaac Newton and the Accidental Gold Standard (1696-1717)
The Great Recoinage crisis
By 1695, England faced monetary catastrophe: nearly 50% of silver content missing from coins through clipping, with 10% outright counterfeit. Mises Institute
reported "no more than ten good shillings for every hundred pounds of revenue." Wikipedia Ox

The Exchequer

Newton, appointed Warden in March 1696 through Charles Montague's patronage, took what was meant as a sinecure with characteristic seriousness. Wikipedia The Great Recoinage Act
(January 1696) committed to melting all silver coins and reissuing at full weight— Ox +2 but the Royal Mint was "woefully unprepared." Ox +2 Only 15% of needed coin was minted
before the June 24 demonetization deadline, causing the economy to "essentially stop" in late 1696. Wikipedia
Newton's industrial brilliance saved the operation. He established provincial mints (York, Bristol, Exeter, Chester, Norwich), created sophisticated monitoring systems tracking daily
production, and prosecuted counterfeiters relentlessly (most famously William Chaloner, executed March 23, 1699). Wikipedia +3 The operation coined £6.8 million 1696-1699—more
than the preceding 35 years combined.

The 1717 decision that changed monetary history
Despite the successful recoinage, silver continued flowing out—exactly as Newton had warned. His September 21, 1717 report to the Treasury is a masterpiece of empirical monetary
economics:
He surveyed international gold-silver ratios through direct assay: "In the end of King William's reign...I caused a great many [foreign coins] to be assayed in the Mint." His findings:
Spain/Portugal 16:1, France 15:1, Holland 15:1, with European average 14.8-15:1. gold
Newton's recommendation: Reduce the guinea from 21s 6d to about 21 shillings to align England with European markets and stop silver drain. gold

The December 1717 Royal Proclamation set guineas at exactly 21 shillings, establishing a gold-silver ratio of approximately 15.5:1—slightly overvaluing gold versus the European
average. Wikipedia

How this accidentally created the gold standard
This seemingly small difference (15.5 vs. 15:1) had profound consequences through Gresham's Law: undervalued silver flowed out, overvalued gold flowed in. Wikipedia
explicitly sought to create a functioning bimetallic standard; instead he triggered silver's disappearance from circulation.

3. Medieval Bills of Exchange: Sophisticated Financial Engineering
Step-by-step mechanics of the four-party system
The bill of exchange was far more than a payment instrument—it was primarily a credit and foreign exchange speculation device disguised to circumvent usury prohibitions. Wikipedia

Actual documented transaction (Bruges-Barcelona, 1399-1400) from Datini Archives of Prato:
THE CAMBIUM (Initial Bill, December 12, 1399):
1. Deliverer (Jacopo Goscio in Bruges): Lends 600 Flemish écus = £55 0s 0d gros Flemish
2. Taker (Orlandini-Benizi Company, Bruges): Borrows by selling bill drawn on Barcelona, uses funds to buy Flemish woollens for export
3. Payer (Francesco da Prato & Co., Barcelona): Accepts bill January 11, agrees to pay at maturity
4. Payee (Domenico Sancio, Barcelona): Receives £312 10s 0d Barcelonese on February 11
Exchange rate used: 10s 5d Barcelonese per écu (inflated above market) utoronto
THE RECAMBIUM (Return Bill, February 11, 1400):
Now Domenico Sancio becomes new deliverer, purchasing return bill to remit funds back to original lender Jacopo Goscio.
Final payment (April 11): 625 écus = £57 5s 10d Flemish

How merchants avoided usury prohibitions
The profit was concealed within exchange rate manipulation. Canon law defined usury as pricing usance (time between acceptance and maturity)—charging for money in terms of itself
across time. Substack +2 Bills avoided this by:
1. Two currencies: Pricing one money against a different money (legally distinct)
2. Uncertainty: Return wasn't predetermined—exchange rates could fluctuate before recambium
3. Hidden interest: Profit embedded in deliberately inflated exchange rates on both legs utoronto ScienceDirect
As Raymond de Roover concluded: bills' "great contribution" was enabling usury circumvention without fraud—the "uncertainty" provided legal cover even though merchants knew they'd
profit from the spread. George Mason University Taylor & Francis
Explicitly forbidden: Dry Exchange (cambium siccum)
Fake bill transactions with prearrangement between parties

4. International Gold Settlements: Theory Versus Reality
The gold points mechanism
Under the classical gold standard, physical gold only moved when exchange rates hit "gold points"—the bounds determined by shipping costs. For dollar-sterling after 1880: ~1% total
spread (freight, insurance, brokerage, interest loss during transit). EH.net
Most settlements occurred through bills of exchange, not gold. Only net imbalances after multilateral clearing required gold shipment. Mises Institute NBER

Why foreign lenders needed gold specifically
1. Universal acceptability: No real-time verification of creditworthiness across borders; gold was self-validating
2. Legal protection: International loans included "gold clauses" requiring repayment in gold or gold-equivalent (Liberty Bonds: "payable in United States gold coin of the present
standard of value") EH.net
3. Fixed exchange rates: Under gold standard, currencies had fixed gold content (£1 = $4.8665, ratio of gold content), eliminating currency risk Mises Institute NBER
4. Higher value-to-weight than silver: Easier to transport large sums

Bank of England reserve management: Walking the tightrope
The Bank maintained remarkably low gold reserves (often <20% reserve-deposit ratio) compared to other central banks, relying instead on Bank Rate manipulation. Cato +4
1847 Crisis case study (from Dornbusch & Frenkel NBER #1039):
Phase 1 (January-April): Harvest failure required massive grain imports
Bullion fell 40% (£14.26m → £8.80m)
Note reserves fell 70% (£8.23m → £2.56m)
Reserve-deposit ratio: 46% → 19.6%
Bank sterilized gold outflow by lowering reserve ratio
April 17: Reserve £2.56m, ratio 19.6%—crisis threshold Mises Institute
Phase 2 (October): Grain payment settlements came due
October 23: Reserve £1.55m, ratio 11.6%—genuine insolvency risk
October 25: Government suspended Bank Charter Act (authorized fiduciary issue beyond legal limits) Bank Underground
Condition: No discount below 10%
Bank Rate raised to 8%, then 10%—" Mises Institute Seven percent will draw gold home from the moon" (Bagehot-era saying)
Gold response: Russian Emperor invested "four and a half million sterling" in British Consols within 7 weeks, attracted by high yields. Econometric evidence: gold flows responded to
interest rates with 4-week and 7-week lags (London-New York and London-St. Petersburg round-trip times). Mises Institute Equation: ΔBullion = -0.892 + 0.179×Interest(t-4) +
0.795×Interest(t-7), R² = 0.75.
By December: Bullion £11.61m, reserve £7.79m, rate down to 5.7%.

Reality diverged from Hume's theory
David Hume's 1752 price-specie flow mechanism predicted: gold outflow → reduced money supply → lower domestic prices → restored competitiveness. World Gold Council
Wikipedia But evidence shows:
Prices remained stable and convergent across countries (Gallarotti 1995), not divergent as theory predicted
Capital flows dominated trade flows: John Stuart Mill (1871): "passage of precious metals determined much more by state of loan market...much less by state of prices" Mises
Institute
Central banks sterilized flows: Bloomfield (1959) found central banks followed "rules of the game" in only 40% of cases
The actual adjustment mechanism was interest rates attracting/repelling capital, far faster than price adjustments. Wikipedia

5. Bank Restriction Act (1797-1821): The First Successful Fiat Experiment
What triggered suspension
February 22-24, 1797: French invasion at Fishguard, Wales
February 25: News reaches London
February 26: Privy Council suspends convertibility
February 27: Bank of England suspends specie payments by Order in Council Blogger +2
But the invasion was merely the trigger. Multiple causative factors:
1. Severely depleted reserves: £8 million (1791) → less than £1 million (February 1797)
2. War financing: Heavy government borrowing 1793-1797 for French Revolutionary Wars

3. Provincial bank runs: Newcastle, Sunderland, Durham had already drained Bank reserves
4. France's remonetization after assignats collapse, demanding precious metals
5. Poor harvests 1795-1796 requiring food imports ResearchGate
By February 27, notes in circulation (£10,865,050) were almost exactly twice the gold reserves (£5,322,010). Wikipedia

How unbacked paper maintained value
This is the critical question for understanding fiat money. O'Brien & Palma's thesis (2020): "The policy succeeded thanks to the reputation of the Bank of England, achieved through a
century of prudential collaboration between the Bank and the Treasury." Oxford Academic LSE Research Online
Unlike continental experiments, the Bank had maintained stability 1694-1797 without hyperinflation even during Seven Years War and American Revolutionary War. Public trusted
eventual convertibility. qmul Mises Institute
Supporting factors:
1. Credible commitment: Act initially announced as temporary (one year), later extended "until definite peace signed"—strict time frame bolstered confidence BRANCH COVE
2. Merchant support: February 28 (day after suspension), London's prominent merchants issued statement supporting use of Bank notes BRANCH
3. Moderate inflation: Despite suspension, "war finance did not produce any great effects upon prices and foreign exchange-rates until about 1800" (Schumpeter). This was not
hyperinflation. Qmul
4. Fiscal backing: New taxes including direct income tax (1798) demonstrated government capacity to service debt
5. War success: Britain ultimately won, validating confidence
Price evidence:
1797-1801: Prices increased 50%
1809-1810 peak: Gold bullion £4.9s to £4.12s per ounce (15.5% above mint price) LBMA
1813-1821: Deflation back toward 1797 levels
Note circulation: Peaked 1814 at £28.4 million backed by only £2.2 million gold. By 1821 resumption: £2.3 million notes backed by £11.2 million bullion—ratio completely reversed.

The Bullionist Controversy: Economics' first great policy debate
Bullionist position (Ricardo, Wheatley, Horner):
Rising prices and falling exchange rate caused by over-issue of Bank notes
Solution: Restore convertibility at 1797 parity
Simple quantity theory application
Anti-Bullionist position (Bank directors, Vansittart, Bosanquet):
Rising prices from poor harvests (real shock)
Falling exchange from food imports and subsidies to allies
Country banks responsible, not Bank of England
Real Bills Doctrine: If Bank discounts only good commercial paper, note issue merely follows "needs of trade" and cannot cause inflation Springer econstor
The Bullion Report (June 1810): Select Committee chaired by Francis Horner, featuring Henry Thornton, concluded:
Blamed Bank of England for not contracting note issue
Rejected Real Bills Doctrine: called it "wholly erroneous in principle, and pregnant with dangerous consequences in practice"
Recommended restoration within two years Peter Harrington Peter Harrington
Parliamentary fate: All resolutions rejected 1810-1811 by large majorities. econstor

Henry Thornton: The unsung genius
Thornton's An Inquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain (1802) is arguably the single most important pre-20th century monetary work. econstor
contributions:

His

Two-interest-rate model: "In order to ascertain how far the desire of obtaining loans at the bank may be expected...we must enquire into the subject of the quantum of profit likely to be
derived from borrowing there...this question turns principally on a comparison of the rate of interest taken at the bank with the current rate of mercantile profit."
This is the foundation for all subsequent "natural rate vs. market rate" theories including Wicksell's cumulative process. econstor
Lender of last resort doctrine: Bank should hold large reserves, lend freely during internal drains, distinguish temporary vs. permanent external drains.
Discretionary policy: Advocated flexible monetary management, but by 1810 concluded Bank needed legal constraint. econstor
On deflation (1802, p.118): "The tendency of a very great and sudden reduction in the accustomed number of bank notes, is to create an unusual and temporary distress...There is reason to
fear that the unnatural and extraordinarily low price would occasion much discouragement of the fabrication of manufactures." econstor
David Laidler's assessment: "Paper Credit arguably marks it as the single most important product of the Bullionist controversy, perhaps indeed of the whole 19th century literature of
monetary economics before Wicksell's Interest and Prices (1898)." econstor

The return to gold (1821)

Industrial unemployment, particularly Birmingham metal-working Free Life
Ricardo's criticism: Blamed Bank for too rapid contraction. "The evils of the time arose from the Bank's not having followed his advice" for gradual reduction. Wikipedia
Thomas Attwood's assessment: Peel's Act created "More misery, more poverty, more discord, more of everything that was calamitous to the nation, except death, than Attila caused in the
Roman Empire."

6. The Gold Standard's Collapse: Churchill, France, and Bretton Woods
Churchill's 1925 blunder
April 28, 1925: Chancellor Winston Churchill announced UK return to gold at pre-war parity: $4.86 per pound. TrendSpider
The problem: Market rate in January 1925 was $4.77. The official rate represented approximately 10% overvaluation.
Keynes's prediction ("Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill," July 1925):
10% overvaluation = 10% effective reduction in export receipts
Required 10% reduction in ALL money wages and prices to restore competitiveness
Transfer of £1 billion to rentiers from rest of economy
Increased real burden of National Debt by £750 million
The consequences: Deflation, unemployment, especially coal industry → coal miners' strike → General Strike of 1926. Overvalued pound drained gold reserves, forcing Bank of England
to maintain tight monetary policy. High unemployment throughout 1925-1931 until forced off gold September 21, 1931. Economic History Everything Everywhere
Churchill should have: Returned at lower parity reflecting wartime inflation, OR waited until prices adjusted.

France and US: The gold sinks of the Great Depression
The catastrophic maldistribution:
France's share of world gold reserves: 7% (1926) → 27% (1932). By 1932, France held nearly as much gold as US despite economy being 1/4 the size. NBER +3
Causes of French accumulation:
1. Undervalued franc (1926 Poincaré stabilization) creating persistent balance of payments surplus
2. Monetary Law of June 1928:
Restored convertibility at undervalued rate
Prohibited Bank of France from holding foreign exchange (forcing conversion to gold)
Required 35% minimum gold cover ratio (Bank wanted 40%)
Banned open market operations Economic History

US share: +1%
France share: +24%
Rest of world: 0%
"Excess gold" held (vs. 1928 cover ratios):
1929: US and France held 6% of world stock as excess
1930: 11% of world stock
1931: 12% of world stock (France 80% responsibility) American Economic Association nber
Impact on world prices:
Wholesale prices fell 34% (1928-1932)
US and French gold hoarding explains approximately 40% of this deflation
Historical relationship (1870-1914): 3% annual gold growth needed for price stability
World gold stock grew 18% (1928-1933) = 3.4% annually
Expected: Prices roughly stable
Actual: Prices fell 42% NBER nber

Contemporary warnings (ignored):
Gustav Cassel (1928-1932): Warned repeatedly about gold shortage and hoarding
Keynes (January 1929): "A difficult, and even dangerous situation is developing"
Allyn Young (January 1929): Called gold hoarding "financial nationalism" NBER American Economic Association
By end of 1932: US + France held over 60% of world's monetary gold.

"foil" (debtor), with notches indicating amounts (£1,000 = palm width, £100 = thumb breadth, etc.) ✓ Specific examples:
1297: William de Brochose entrusted with 60 shillings plus tally
Late 13th century: Tally for £9 4s 3d found in Milk Street cesspit (Museum of London)
1697: Bank of England "Engrafted Stock"—£1 million for £800,000 tallies at par + £200,000 banknotes ✓ Functioned as tax receipts, currency (circulated at discount), and forward
financing instruments ✓ System ended 1826; accumulated tallies burned October 16, 1834—fire destroyed Houses of Parliament
Egyptian grain banks (Ptolemaic period, 323-30 BC):

✓ Nationwide network of government granaries functioning as banks ✓ Centralized accounting from Alexandria headquarters ✓ Grain deposits could be transferred between accounts
without physical movement ✓ Owners could write orders of withdrawal for debts, taxes, purchases ✓ Historian M. Rostovtzeff: "The grain bank network of Ptolemaic Egypt is the only
banking institution of the ancient world that bears comparison with the greatest banks of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries" ✓ Earlier evidence: 5,300-year-old bone labels from King
Scorpion I tomb (c. 3300 BC) describing inventory
Chinese paper money:

✓ 7th century AD: Private bills of credit during Tang Dynasty ✓ 960-1127 AD: First government-issued paper money (jiaozi) during Northern Song ✓ Motivation: Iron coins too heavy (11
kg per 1,000 coins; horse cost = ox cart of coins) ✓ 1271: Kublai Khan's Yuan Dynasty: silver-backed paper as sole legal tender—documented by Marco Polo ✓ Over-issuance led to
hyperinflation and collapse by Ming Dynasty (1368) ✓ Issued 600+ years before Sweden (1661), USA (1692), France (1716)

What's contested (active scholarly debate)
Interpretation disputes:

✗ Whether Mesopotamian temples were primarily bureaucratic or had significant market elements: The Dreham Archive debate illustrates this:
Mahoney (1965): Bureaucratic depot with hierarchical organization
Thomson (1972): Computer analysis suggests free market for animals comparable to Nebraska small farms 1940-1960
Problem: Tablets omit crucial context (origin, destinations, whether private transactions)

✗ Whether credit systems were "natural" or required state enforcement: Chartalists (Knapp, Innes, Graeber, Hudson, Wray) argue state power essential; Austrian economists (Menger,
Mises, Rothbard) argue spontaneous emergence possible
✗ Whether absence of barter evidence proves it never existed: Caroline Humphrey's 1985 statement—"No example of a barter economy, pure and simple, has ever been described"—
cited by Graeber, but Humphrey's fuller work more nuanced, discussing "delayed barter" within communities
✗ Whether Mesopotamian interest reflected productivity, risk, or was purely conventional: Hudson argues rates set for mathematical convenience (unit fractions), remained stable
regardless of profit rates—"most fatal to productivity theories: majority of Mesopotamian agrarian debts did not result from actual loans, but accrued as arrears"
✗ Whether early debt was exploitative or facilitated productive investment: Moses Finley found "lending occurred almost entirely in spheres of commercial trade and agrarian usury"
with no evidence for productivity-based interest
✗ Whether money "had to" originate from states: China and Mesopotamia were state-based, but stateless alternatives not well-studied
✗ Whether Clean Slates were economically beneficial or represented repeated failure: Hudson sees them as economic stabilization preventing debt bondage undermining
military/corvée labor supply; critics suggest repeated crises

Graeber's argument and its critics
Core claims (Debt: The First 5,000 Years, 2011):
1. Credit/debt preceded money, money preceded barter (opposite of textbooks)
2. Virtual/credit money came first; coins came much later
3. Barter mainly occurs between strangers or when monetary systems collapse
4. State violence necessary for monetary systems
5. Money originated from: (a) taxes/tribute, (b) provisioning armies, (c) wergild (injury compensation)
Critical support: Caroline Humphrey (1985): "No example of a barter economy, pure and simple, has ever been described, let alone the emergence from it of money"
Scholarly criticisms:
Jeffrey Rogers Hummel (San Jose State/Cato): "Very bad book...much too polemical"
Definitional problems: Graeber's concept of "barter" excludes debt transactions, making claim tautological
"Credit transactions preceded spot transactions" incompatible with "media of account emerged before media of exchange"—credit requires either barter goods or media of exchange
Misrepresents scholars: "misspells Carl Menger's first name as 'Karl' and mistakenly accuses [him] of 'adding various mathematical equations'" (possibly confusing economist with
mathematician son)

"Misrepresents even scholarly work tending to support his conclusions, such as Caroline Humphrey's article"
Mike Beggs (Jacobin, 2012): "Fantastic material...but main arguments wholly unconvincing"
Excessive focus on "cultural and political superstructure" vs. economic logics
Claims about commodity vs. credit money distinction problematic
Robert Murphy (Austrian economist): Graeber argues anthropologists haven't found barter economies, therefore they didn't exist—but Menger asked "could money have emerged from
barter?" not "did it?" Absence of evidence ≠ evidence of absence for prehistoric societies.

Balanced synthesis
What your manuscript should note:
1. Strong evidence for ancient credit systems: Mesopotamian tablets, Egyptian grain banks, tally sticks are physical artifacts demonstrating sophisticated credit before widespread
coinage
2. Timeline supports credit-first: Accounting for economic activity clearly predates physical money as medium of exchange
3. State role substantial but contested: All documented ancient systems involved states/temples, but whether state was necessary versus merely present remains debatable
4. Barter absence is absence of evidence: No anthropological documentation of pure barter-to-money evolution, but prehistoric period may not be preserved/observable
5. Interpretation varies by politics: MMT/chartalist scholars emphasize state power; Austrian/mainstream economists emphasize spontaneous order—both capture partial truths
6. Both credit and commodity aspects coexisted: Not either/or but both/and—money had credit functions AND commodity-like features (metals chosen for portability, divisibility,
durability)
Recommendation: Present evidence from both sides; acknowledge debates; distinguish well-established facts from interpretive controversies; note political dimensions while maintaining
scholarly objectivity.

8. Feudal to Monetary Taxation: Creating Demand for Currency
The mechanisms and timeline
Early feudal system (pre-12th century):
Labor services (corvée), agricultural produce (champart: 4-25% of harvest in France), military service
Banalité in France: forced use of lord's mill/bakery for fees
Food rent (feorm) in Anglo-Saxon England
Initial monetary taxation (11th-12th centuries):
England 1012: Heregeld (literally "army tax")—first regular money tax, collected by King Æthelred the Unready to pay mercenaries against Danish invasion. Rate: 2 shillings per hide
(land unit). Coinage introduced to "make payment of taxes easier." Continued until 1162.
England 1100: Scutage (from Latin scutum, "shield")—knights could pay money instead of military service. Rates varied 13s 4d to £2 per knight's fee.
Acceleration (12th-13th centuries): Scutage expanded "with the expansion of money economy in Europe." "The increasing use of mercenaries in the 12th century would make a money
payment of greater use to the crown."
Hundred Years War catalyst (1337-1453): Shift from exceptional to permanent taxation.
Regional variations:

Region
Timeline
England 1012: Heregeld; 1100: Scutage; 1334: Moveable property tax standardized; 1377-1381: Poll taxes → Peasants' Revolt
France 1295-1296: Centième/cinquantième; 1355: 100 hearths for man-at-arms; 1422-1461: Taille made permanent
Italy
12th century: Communes developed taxation earlier; Frederick I Barbarossa: fodrum raised to 30,000 silver marks
Sweden 1320-1550: Dramatic swings—low 1320-1363, very high 1365-1424 (177g silver annually = 105kg butter = ~15% farm value), low post-1436 after Engelbrek
Germany Varied by territory; Gotha (1391), Bregenz (1407), Rottweil (1420), Worms (1421), Salzburg (1458), Bundschuh revolts, Peasants' War (1524-25)

Why monarchs wanted money instead of goods
1. Military flexibility and mercenaries:
Mercenaries required cash payment, not produce
Feudal service had 40-day limit: "troops usually quite eager to go home as soon as the 40 day obligation was up"—"this time limit could prove very inconvenient"
Knights could "pay money (scutage) instead of showing up" and many "somehow never got around to it"
"The combination of mercenaries and regular taxation enabled states to raise larger armies and to keep them in the field for longer than before"
2. State building:
Money taxation required permanent bureaucracy (collectors, assessors, record-keepers) independent of feudal relationships
"Tax is the fuel that drives the state's engine of expansion, namely war"
3. Breaking feudal power:
Philip IV the Fair (1268-1314): "His primary goal was to replace the feudal militia with a disciplined mercenary army subordinated to the king"
Direct taxation weakened feudal intermediaries
"The French monarch was able to triple his income through taxes from the start to the end of the war"

4. Geographic flexibility: Money transported more easily than goods; enabled financing campaigns abroad
5. Predictable revenue: In-kind payments varied by harvest quality; money provided more predictable streams

Connection to military financing
Anglo-Saxon England (1012):
Heregeld explicitly to "pay for mercenaries in the army and navy"
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records £132,000 in tribute payments 991-1012
Hundred Years War as transformation:
England:
Edward III had to "cajole, defraud, and coerce wool merchants into loaning him money just to get an army across the English Channel"
War taxation became regular: wool subsidies voted repeatedly
"From 1377 turned to a new system of poll taxes, aiming to spread the costs across the entirety of English society"
1377: 4 pence per person over 14
1380: One shilling (12 pence) per person over 15—"three times the 1377 tax"
Most peasants earned only one groat (4 pence) per week
1381 Peasants' Revolt directly caused by war costs
France:
"During the Hundred Years' War, these exceptional tax levies suddenly became regular ones"
Charles V (1338-1380) "first to dispose of an income tax, now holding both the fiscal and the military monopoly"
"The professional standing army that Charles V had been able to create and finance" was key to French success
Under Francis I (1494-1547): Taille increased from 9 to 16 million livres
Richelieu period (1628-1635): Tax burden tripled
Mercenary economics:
Monthly pay of simple mercenary: 4 gulden (more than average craftsman, almost double farm hand wage)
Regimental commanders: 500 gulden per month
Mercenaries preferred wars of attrition to "draw wages for a longer period of time"

How monetary taxation created demand for money (chartalist mechanism)
Theoretical framework:
Georg Friedrich Knapp (State Theory of Money, 1905): "Money is a creature of law" rather than commodity
Alfred Mitchell-Innes (1914): "Whenever a tax is imposed, each taxpayer becomes responsible for the redemption of a small part of the debt which the government has contracted by its
issues of money...He has to acquire his portion of the debt from some holder of a coin...The redemption of government debt by taxation is the basic law of coinage"
Adam Smith observed: "A prince, who should enact that a certain proportion of his taxes should be paid in a paper money of a certain kind, might thereby give a certain value to this paper
money"
Practical effects on peasants:
Forced monetization:
Peasants previously in subsistence/barter economy forced into cash economy
"Individual peasant farmers selling their produce at market in order to raise money for rent were a commonplace in saint's lives and miracle collections of the ninth century and after"
Forced to "sell their produce to earn a living while the lords and kings earned taxes through these market trades"
When peasants couldn't pay—devastating consequences:
Asset seizure:
1381 England: "It obliges the common people to sell cows, vessels, and clothes"
"If they could not pay in cash, they could pay in kind, such as seeds, tools etc., anything that could be vital to survival in the coming year"
Violence and imprisonment:
Tax collectors backed by "detachments of soldiers enforcing tax law"
In France: Collectors "responsible for getting the entire amount. If the collected amount was insufficient, the tax collectors had to cover the difference at their own expense or go to
jail"
Revolts:
England 1381: Fobbing villagers "threw out" tax collector; when soldiers arrived, "thrown out as the villagers had now organised themselves"
France 1382: Harelle and Maillotin revolts over tax reinstatement
Sweden 1434-1436: Engelbrekt rebellion; "castles, which played a central role in the extortion of taxes, were often attacked and destroyed"
Germany 1524/25: Peasants' War with monetary complaints prominent
Contemporary testimony: English source c.1380: "Lords do wrong to poor men by unreasonable taxes...and they perish from hunger and thirst and cold, and their children also...And in
this manner the lords eat and drink poor men's flesh and blood"

Validation of chartalist/MMT interpretation
The medieval evidence strongly supports the chartalist mechanism:
1. Temporal sequence: States issued/mandated coins BEFORE demanding tax payment in those coins

2. Enforcement: Heavy penalties for non-payment created compulsion
3. Value creation: Coins accepted because needed for tax obligations
4. Non-market origins: Taxation preceded full market monetization
5. Administrative priority: Coinage introduced "to make payment of taxes easier"
How it worked:
1. King declares tax payable in specific coins (e.g., heregeld in silver pennies)
2. Creates demand: Peasants must obtain coins to avoid punishment
3. Forces market participation: Must sell goods/labor to earn coins
4. Sustains circulation: Coins have value because needed for recurring taxes
5. State controls money supply: Through monopoly on minting
Contemporary evidence: "There is a popular image of the middle ages as a world of barter, and of payment in kind or in labour. Yet the reality was that everyone from the king down to
the humblest peasant used coins" (Cambridge course notes). "This trend towards monetization was growing significantly during the period from Domesday Book (1086) to the Black Death
in 1348."
Qualifications: Money also used for other purposes (gifts, trade, debt settlement). Not solely taxes but "general acceptance" matters. Some periods had currency without extensive taxation.
Manuscript recommendation: This is strong evidence for MMT/chartalist perspective on medieval period. State taxation did create sustained demand for coined money and forced
peasant monetization. However, note that modern oil-rich states have currencies without heavy taxation, so mechanism not universal across all times/places.

Key Recommendations for Your Manuscript
Areas Where MMT/Chartalist View is Well-Supported
1. Ancient Mesopotamian credit systems: Strong archaeological evidence; tablets are physical artifacts demonstrating sophisticated accounting before coinage
2. English tally sticks: Unambiguous example of state-issued credit instruments functioning as currency
3. Medieval taxation creating money demand: Clear historical sequence of tax imposition → forced monetization → market participation
4. Bank Restriction period: Successful fiat experiment demonstrating institutional credibility can substitute for commodity backing
5. State role in monetary systems: All documented ancient/medieval systems involved state or state-like institutions (temples/palaces)

Areas Requiring Nuance/Qualification
1. "Money never emerged from barter": Lack of anthropological evidence doesn't prove it never happened; prehistoric period may not preserve/be observable. Say "no documented
cases" rather than "never occurred"
2. Mesopotamian temple systems: Scholars debate bureaucratic vs. market elements (Dreham Archive controversy); note interpretation disputes
3. Whether state is necessary: All observed systems were state-based, but whether state was necessary versus merely present is contested
4. Clean Slates: Could represent successful stabilization OR repeated failure to develop functioning credit markets—both interpretations defensible
5. Modern applicability: Medieval tax-driven money occurred in context of subsistence economies; modern economies more complex

Corrections Needed
1. Bank of England loan creation: If manuscript says "Bank printed money to lend to government," clarify it initially raised capital through subscription, then shifted to note-issue
funding by 1697
2. Newton's intention: If manuscript suggests Newton intended gold standard, emphasize it was accidental—he sought bimetallic system
3. Gold standard adjustment: If manuscript describes Hume's price-specie flow as how it worked, note reality diverged—capital flows and interest rates dominated
4. Barter myth: If manuscript says "economists claim money emerged from barter," note Menger asked logical question, not making historical claim; later textbook treatments
oversimplified
5. French responsibility for Depression: If manuscript focuses on US, note France accumulated 27% of world gold by 1932 and was arguably more responsible than US (per Irwin,
Johnson, Mouré)

Gaps to Fill
1. Bill of exchange mechanics: Most readers won't understand these; step-by-step example enriches narrative
2. Specific numbers: Manuscript needs concrete figures (reserve ratios, interest rates, gold flows, tax amounts)
3. Human cost of deflation/taxation: Contemporary testimony from 1381 Peasants' Revolt, post-1925 unemployment, etc.
4. Why mercenaries mattered: 40-day feudal service limit, knights' unreliability, need for professional armies
5. Bretton Woods negotiation dynamics: Keynes as "rock star" but powerless; White controlling proceedings; USSR rejection
6. Multiple perspectives: For contested topics, present both chartalist AND commodity theorist views
This research provides extensive sourcing for your manuscript's MMT-influenced perspective while maintaining scholarly rigor by noting contested interpretations. The evidence strongly
supports state/credit origins of money in documented ancient systems, sophisticated medieval financial instruments, and taxation creating money demand—but intellectual honesty requires
acknowledging ongoing debates and avoiding overclaiming where evidence is ambiguous.
