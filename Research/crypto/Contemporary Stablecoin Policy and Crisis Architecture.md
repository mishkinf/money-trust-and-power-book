# Contemporary Stablecoin Policy and Crisis Architecture: A Framework Analysis

The United States has enacted the world's first comprehensive stablecoin regulatory framework while simultaneously prohibiting Federal Reserve issuance of central bank digital currencies, creating a novel monetary architecture where **private issuers hold approximately $130-145 billion in U.S. Treasuries with no access to Federal Reserve emergency facilities**. This deliberate policy structure—allowing Treasury-backed stablecoins while restricting Fed backstops—represents a historically unprecedented separation between reserve asset backing and lender-of-last-resort access, with implications for both dollar hegemony and financial stability comparable to the 2008 money market fund crisis that required $217 billion in emergency Federal Reserve lending.

The research reveals three critical findings. First, the GENIUS Act (enacted July 18, 2025) explicitly permits stablecoin reserves in Treasury bills with ≤93-day maturity while stating "nothing in this Act shall expand or contract the legal eligibility to receive services available from a Federal Reserve bank," effectively denying discount window access. Second, major stablecoin issuers Tether and Circle have become the 18th-largest holder of U.S. Treasuries globally, controlling approximately 2-2.25% of the $6 trillion T-bill market as foreign official demand has declined from 35% (2020) to 30% (2024) of total Treasury holdings. Third, this architecture mirrors 2008 money market fund structures that broke down within three days, requiring unprecedented government intervention, yet stablecoins operate with less regulation, no deposit insurance, and no pre-established Federal Reserve liquidity facilities.

This report documents the legislative framework, market structure, Federal Reserve authorities, historical precedents, and international responses based on primary sources including congressional bill texts, Federal Reserve testimony, attestation reports, and official government documents. The analysis supports rigorous historical comparison between contemporary stablecoin policy and past episodes of reserve currency management crisis, from the 1797 Bank Restriction Act through 2008 shadow banking collapse.

## Stablecoin legislation establishes Treasury backing without Federal Reserve safety nets

The 119th Congress enacted three interconnected pieces of digital asset legislation creating the most comprehensive stablecoin regulatory framework globally while blocking any Federal Reserve-issued central bank digital currency. The GENIUS Act (S. 1582, "Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act") passed the Senate 68-30 on June 17, 2025, passed the House 308-122 on July 17, and was signed into law by President Trump on July 18, 2025. Lead sponsor Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) introduced the bill on May 1, 2025, with bipartisan co-sponsors including Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC), Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY).

The Act mandates 1:1 reserve backing with explicitly permitted assets including **U.S. Treasury bills, notes, or bonds with remaining maturity of 93 days or less**, repurchase agreements backed by Treasuries, government money market funds, Federal Reserve deposits, and bank deposits at insured institutions. Section 4(a)(1)(A) specifies that issuers must "maintain identifiable reserves backing the outstanding payment stablecoins...on an at least 1 to 1 basis" with reserves comprising these liquid, government-backed instruments. Critically, stablecoins cannot pay interest to holders, and reserve assets cannot be pledged, rehypothecated, or reused—ensuring true segregation.

The regulatory structure establishes dual federal-state oversight with **three pathways**: federally-chartered issuers regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, state-chartered issuers (under $10 billion can remain state-regulated), and subsidiaries of insured depository institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve. The Act requires monthly public disclosure of reserve composition, CEO/CFO certification of reserve accuracy (with criminal penalties for false certification), and annual audited financial statements for issuers exceeding $50 billion. All issuers must implement Bank Secrecy Act compliance including anti-money laundering programs and technical capability to freeze, block, or burn stablecoins pursuant to lawful orders.

Section 4(a)(13) contains the most consequential provision for crisis response: "Nothing in this Act shall be construed as expanding or contracting the legal eligibility to receive services available from a Federal Reserve bank or to make deposits with a Federal Reserve bank." Section 4(d)(1) reinforces this limitation: "Payment stablecoins shall not be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, guaranteed by the United States Government, subject to deposit insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or subject to share insurance by the National Credit Union Administration." This structure explicitly **allows Treasury securities as reserves while simultaneously denying automatic Fed master account access, discount window eligibility, deposit insurance, and government guarantees**.

The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act (H.R. 1919), introduced by House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) in March 2025, passed the House 219-217 in July 2025 and awaits Senate action. The bill prohibits the Board of Governors from designing, building, developing, establishing, or issuing a central bank digital currency "absent Congressional authorization." Section 4 defines CBDC as "a form of digital money or monetary value that is—(i) denominated in the national unit of account; (ii) a direct liability of the Federal Reserve System; and (iii) widely available to the general public." The prohibition extends to direct issuance to individuals, indirect issuance through financial intermediaries, and use for monetary policy implementation. Notably, the bill includes a carve-out protecting "open, permissionless, and private currency" including Bitcoin and Ethereum, while specifically targeting government-issued digital currencies.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified before the Senate Banking Committee on February 11, 2025, stating "Stablecoins may have a big future with consumers and businesses. We can't know that now, but it is important for the development of stablecoins in a safe and sound manner that protects consumers and savers." When asked directly if he would oppose launching a CBDC in the U.S., Powell responded affirmatively, committing that the Federal Reserve would not launch a CBDC during his tenure as Chair. In June 2025 House testimony, Powell said "I think it's a great thing that bills are moving. We need a stablecoin framework," demonstrating Federal Reserve support for congressional legislation while maintaining opposition to CBDCs.

The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (H.R. 3633), introduced May 29, 2025, passed the House 294-134 in July 2025 during "Crypto Week" and awaits Senate action. This broader market structure bill divides regulatory jurisdiction between the SEC (investment contract assets) and CFTC (digital commodities), while explicitly incorporating Anti-CBDC provisions in Title VI and deferring to the GENIUS Act for stablecoin-specific regulation.

## Stablecoin issuers hold $130 billion in Treasuries, ranking among top global holders

The global stablecoin market reached **$250-307 billion** in total capitalization as of late 2024/early 2025, according to DefiLlama and industry trackers, recovering from a contraction during the 2022-2023 period following the Terra/LUNA collapse and banking crisis. The market grew approximately **59% during 2024** alone, demonstrating rapid expansion as regulatory clarity emerged. Tether (USDT) dominates with **$155-158 billion** market capitalization (62-65% market share), while Circle (USDC) holds **$39.4-39.8 billion** as of November 2024 (approximately 25% share). The top two issuers control roughly **90% of the total stablecoin market**, creating significant concentration in this nascent asset class.

Tether Holdings Limited's Q4 2024 attestation report, conducted by BDO Italia and published January 31, 2025, reveals direct and indirect U.S. Treasury exposure of **$113 billion** as of December 31, 2024. The company's official statement declared: "With U.S. Treasury holdings surpassing $113 billion, a reserve buffer exceeding $7 billion, and $45 billion in new token issuance for the year, Tether continues to set the gold standard for stability and trust in the digital assets space." This represents steady growth from $102.5 billion in Q3 2024 and approximately $90 billion in Q1 2024, demonstrating consistent accumulation of Treasury positions throughout the year.

Circle's November 2024 attestation report, examined by Grant Thornton LLP and published December 20, 2024, provides granular reserve composition data. As of November 27, 2024, Circle held **$15.117 billion** in direct U.S. Treasury securities and **$19.343 billion** in U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, totaling approximately **$34.46 billion** in Treasury exposure. All Treasury securities mature within **three months or less**, with specific maturities ranging from days to February 20, 2025 in the November attestation, maintaining extremely short duration to ensure liquidity.

Combined Tether and Circle Treasury holdings of approximately **$130-145 billion** rank them as the **18th-largest holder globally** if treated as a sovereign entity, according to Treasury International Capital (TIC) data analysis and Ark Invest research. For comparison with other major holders: Japan holds $1.1 trillion (largest foreign holder), China holds $772 billion, United Kingdom holds $750 billion, South Korea holds approximately $125-130 billion (just above combined stablecoin holdings), and Germany holds approximately $120 billion (below combined stablecoins). Stablecoin issuers collectively represent approximately **2.0-2.25% of the $6 trillion Treasury bill market** as of June 2025, according to TD Securities analysis, and roughly **0.5% of the total $28 trillion Treasury market**.

The maturity profile demonstrates extreme concentration in short-term instruments complying with money market fund principles and anticipating GENIUS Act requirements. Circle invests exclusively in Treasury securities maturing within three months, with overnight Treasury repos dominating the repo portion. Tether similarly focuses on T-bills with maturities under three months and significant positions in overnight reverse repurchase agreements. The GENIUS Act codifies this practice by requiring stablecoin reserves in Treasuries to have **"remaining maturity of 93 days or less"**—a standard both major issuers already meet.

Tether's domicile presents unique jurisdictional questions. Originally incorporated in the British Virgin Islands with early operations in Hong Kong, Tether completed redomiciliation to **El Salvador in Q4 2024**, obtaining a stablecoin issuer and Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) license. This offshore structure means Tether operates outside direct U.S. federal banking regulation, though it remains subject to U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions compliance and FinCEN anti-money laundering requirements when serving U.S. customers.

Circle completed the opposite trajectory, redomiciling from Ireland to Delaware on July 1, 2024, through an Irish High Court-approved scheme of arrangement. Circle listed publicly on NYSE in June 2025 under ticker CRCL, bringing it fully within U.S. regulatory jurisdiction. Circle maintains **New York State Department of Financial Services BitLicense** (received September 2015), **FinCEN money services business registration**, **SEC-registered government money market fund** (Circle Reserve Fund under Rule 2a-7), and **state money transmitter licenses** across multiple jurisdictions.

Neither issuer currently holds a banking charter or has Federal Reserve master account access. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller proposed "skinny" payment accounts for stablecoin issuers on October 21, 2025, explicitly excluding discount window borrowing and emergency lending access while potentially providing payment system access (Fedwire, ACH). The GENIUS Act remains silent on master account access, leaving decisions entirely to Federal Reserve discretion.

## Federal Reserve emergency authority faces legal barriers to stablecoin support

Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, originally added by the Emergency Relief and Construction Act of 1932 during the Great Depression, provides the Fed's core emergency lending authority during "unusual and exigent circumstances." The provision lay dormant from 1936 to 2008—72 years without use—before becoming the legal foundation for unprecedented crisis interventions during the 2008 financial crisis. The Dodd-Frank Act Section 1101, enacted July 21, 2010, substantially amended Section 13(3) to prevent future single-entity bailouts while preserving systemic crisis response capacity.

The current statutory text (12 USC 343(3)) states: "In unusual and exigent circumstances, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, by the affirmative vote of not less than five members, may authorize any Federal reserve bank, during such periods as the said board may determine, at rates established in accordance with the provisions of section 14, subdivision (d), of this Act, to discount for **any participant in any program or facility with broad-based eligibility**, notes, drafts, and bills of exchange when such notes, drafts, and bills of exchange are indorsed or otherwise secured to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve bank."

Federal Reserve Regulation A (12 CFR § 201.4, effective January 1, 2016) defines "broad-based eligibility" with precision: a program must be "designed to provide liquidity to an identifiable market or sector of the financial system" rather than assisting specific companies avoid bankruptcy, must have **at least five persons or entities eligible to participate**, and cannot be "structured to remove assets from the balance sheet of a single and specific company." The regulation's insolvency prohibition (§ 201.4(d)(5)) bars lending to borrowers in bankruptcy, Federal or State insolvency proceedings, not paying undisputed debts in preceding 90 days, or determined insolvent by the Board.

Additional Dodd-Frank restrictions require **Treasury Secretary prior approval** before establishing any program, assignment of "lendable value" to all collateral with policies "designed to ensure that the security for emergency loans is sufficient to protect taxpayers from losses," **penalty rate pricing** affording liquidity while encouraging repayment, annual termination unless renewed with Treasury approval, and extensive reporting. These requirements fundamentally transformed Section 13(3) from a broad emergency power to a constrained, procedurally demanding authority requiring political approval.

The 2008 financial crisis saw Federal Reserve create multiple facilities under pre-Dodd-Frank Section 13(3) authority. The **Primary Dealer Credit Facility** (March 16, 2008–February 1, 2010) provided overnight loans to all 20 primary dealers, marking the first Fed lending to non-depository financial institutions since the Great Depression, peaking at $155.8 billion on September 29, 2008. The **Commercial Paper Funding Facility** (October 7, 2008–February 1, 2010) allowed any U.S. issuer of highly-rated commercial paper to participate, including non-financial corporations; notably, Ford Motor Company utilized the facility with peak borrowing of $7 billion.

The **Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility** (September 19, 2008–February 1, 2010) provided **$217 billion in nonrecourse loans** to U.S. depository institutions, bank holding companies, and U.S. branches of foreign banks to finance purchases of asset-backed commercial paper from money market mutual funds. This facility's structure proved critical: the Fed lent to **banks**, not directly to money market funds, with banks then purchasing assets from MMFs facing redemption pressure. The $217 billion total, with $150 billion extended in the first two weeks alone (21% of all outstanding ABCP), prevented catastrophic money market fund collapse.

The legal justification for backstopping non-bank money market funds in 2008 and 2020 rested on multiple pillars: MMFs were systemically important to financial system liquidity, holding 40% of outstanding commercial paper and representing $3.5 trillion in assets; "unusual and exigent circumstances" existed following Lehman's bankruptcy and Reserve Primary Fund breaking the buck; the **indirect lending structure**—loans to banks who purchased MMF assets rather than direct MMF lending—satisfied Section 13(3) requirements; all loans were fully secured by high-quality asset-backed commercial paper; and Treasury Secretary approved both facilities and Treasury guarantee program. The September 19, 2008 announcement came just **three days** after Reserve Primary broke the buck on September 16.

Under current law, stablecoin issuers face substantial legal barriers to Federal Reserve emergency facility access. Stablecoins are not depository institutions, not regulated as banks or bank holding companies, not primary dealers with Fed trading relationships, and not eligible for traditional discount window access. The GENIUS Act explicitly states "nothing in this statute shall expand or contract the legal eligibility to receive services from or make deposits with a Federal Reserve Bank," denying automatic access. Dodd-Frank's "broad-based eligibility" requirement demands at least five participants and programs providing liquidity to identifiable financial market sectors rather than aiding specific failing companies.

Three theoretical pathways exist for potential stablecoin facility access, each facing significant obstacles. First, **indirect access** following the money market fund model: the Fed could create facilities lending to banks, with banks then providing liquidity to stablecoin issuers or purchasing their reserves. Second, **regulatory reclassification**: if stablecoin issuers obtain bank charters they become discount window eligible. Third, **broad "any U.S. company" facilities** similar to 2008/2020 TALF. Each pathway would require demonstrating stablecoin disruption threatens broader financial system, Treasury Secretary approval, and legal justification passing Dodd-Frank requirements.

Fed officials have made limited statements on cryptocurrency facility access. Chair Powell's testimony emphasized regulatory framework importance and consumer protection but **never stated stablecoins should access Fed emergency facilities**. Governor Waller's October 21, 2025 proposal for "skinny" payment accounts **explicitly excluded discount window borrowing and emergency lending access**.

## Reserve Primary Fund collapse in 2008 required three-day emergency response

Money market mutual funds held approximately **$3.5 trillion in assets** as of 2007, with prime funds representing about $2 trillion. These investment vehicles promised to maintain $1.00 net asset value through amortized cost accounting while offering same-day or next-day redemption on demand—creating structural similarity to demand deposits but without deposit insurance or Fed discount window access. Prime money market funds held approximately **5-6% in U.S. Treasuries and agency debt**, deliberately maintaining minimal government securities to generate higher yields.

According to iMoneyNet data analyzed by Kacperczyk and Schnabl (2010), prime fund asset composition in January 2006 included **25.6% commercial paper** ($325.3 billion), **21.1% floating-rate notes** ($265.9 billion), **18.7% bank obligations** ($235.3 billion), **14.8% asset-backed commercial paper** ($186.3 billion), **12.0% repurchase agreements** ($151.1 billion), **5.0% Treasuries and agency debt** ($62.5 billion), and **3.1% bank deposits** ($39.4 billion). Notably, **91.4% of prime fund assets originated from the financial industry**, creating concentrated exposure to financial sector stress. MMFs held approximately **40% of outstanding commercial paper**, making them critical to short-term corporate funding markets.

Reserve Primary Fund, with $62.6 billion in assets, held **$785 million in Lehman Brothers commercial paper** (1.2% of portfolio) when Lehman filed for bankruptcy on September 15, 2008. The fund announced breaking the buck at 4:00 PM on September 16, 2008, with NAV of **$0.97 per share**. State Street Bank stopped funding redemptions after honoring $10 billion, and the fund announced a seven-day redemption delay. Redemption requests exceeded **$40 billion by end of day**.

The run accelerated with extraordinary speed. Investors withdrew **$144.5 billion from money market accounts on September 17, 2008**, with total redemptions reaching **$172 billion by September 19**. During the week of September 15-19, approximately **$300 billion (14%) was withdrawn from prime money market funds**. Over four weeks beginning September 10, **prime institutional funds lost $410 billion (30% of assets)** while prime retail funds lost only $40 billion (5% of assets). Simultaneously, government-only money market funds **gained $409 billion (44% increase)** as investors fled to safety.

Money market funds reduced commercial paper holdings by **$200.3 billion (29%)** in the final two weeks of September 2008 alone. Total commercial paper outstanding fell **15% from $1.76 trillion to $1.43 trillion** within one month, freezing short-term credit markets. Asset-backed commercial paper declined from **$1.18 trillion in August 2007 to $745 billion in August 2008**—a **37% contraction**.

The Federal government responded with unprecedented speed and scale. On **September 19, 2008—just three days** after Reserve Primary broke the buck—Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson announced the Temporary Guarantee Program for Money Market Funds backed by the **Exchange Stabilization Fund**, making available up to **$50 billion** to guarantee payment for participating MMFs if NAV fell below $0.995. The program ultimately covered **$3.2 trillion (93% of the MMF market)**, received **zero claims**, and generated **$1.2 billion in fee revenue**.

Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve announced the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF), which began operations September 22, 2008. The facility extended **$217 billion total credit**, with **$150 billion loaned in the first two weeks** representing 21% of all outstanding ABCP. All loans were ultimately repaid in full with interest. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York subsequently disclosed that **28 additional money market funds** had losses large enough to break the buck during September-October 2008 but were rescued through sponsor support—demonstrating that **29 total funds** would have broken the buck absent intervention.

The ultimate recovery for Reserve Primary Fund investors required years. Distributions reached 50% by October 2008, 79 cents on the dollar by December 2008, 99 cents by 2010, and **final distribution of 99.1 cents per share in December 2014**—demonstrating that even with government support and orderly wind-down, investors sustained losses and capital remained locked up for six years.

## European MiCA regulation restricts dollar stablecoins and promotes digital euro

The European Union enacted Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) on May 31, 2023, with entry into force on June 29, 2023. The regulation implemented in phases: stablecoin provisions for asset-referenced tokens (ARTs) and e-money tokens (EMTs) became applicable June 30, 2024, while full application occurred December 30, 2024. MiCA represents the world's first comprehensive crypto-asset regulatory framework.

For asset-referenced tokens including USD-denominated stablecoins like USDT and USDC operating in the EU, Article 23 imposes critical **volume caps when used as means of exchange**: **1 million transactions per day** (quarterly average) OR **€200 million per day transaction value** (quarterly average). When caps are exceeded, issuers must **stop issuing additional tokens**. Article 23(4) grants the European Central Bank and national central banks power to request competent authorities to withdraw issuer authorization, limit issuance amounts, or impose minimum denominations when stablecoins threaten "smooth operation of payment systems, monetary policy transmission, or monetary sovereignty." ECB and central bank opinions are **binding when negative**, providing effective veto over authorization.

Article 32 mandates reserve requirements: reserve assets must be "legally and operationally segregated from the issuer's own assets" and "shall not be encumbered or pledged as collateral." At least **30% of reserves must be held in bank deposits** with EU credit institutions, rising to **60% for significant ARTs**. E-money tokens require full 1:1 backing under Article 48, with significant EMTs keeping at least **60% of funds in deposits with EU credit institutions**.

Authorization requirements create substantial barriers to market entry. ART issuers must demonstrate **own funds of greater of €350,000 or 2% of average reserve assets**. The authorization process requires consultation with European Banking Authority, European Securities and Markets Authority, European Central Bank, and relevant national central banks, with **ECB/central bank opinion on financial stability being binding if negative**. "Significant" tokens—meeting criteria including holders exceeding **10 million**, market cap exceeding **€5 billion**, or average daily transactions exceeding **2.5 million and €500 million**—face direct EBA supervision and enhanced requirements.

The European Central Bank's digital euro project entered the **preparation phase** on October 18, 2023. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated in January 2025 that the ECB targets **EU legislation in 2026 and public use by 2029**. The digital euro design incorporates **hybrid architecture**: account-based for online transactions and token-based for offline transactions providing cash-like privacy. The June 2024 progress report states: "When paying offline, personal transaction details would only be known to the payer and the payee and would not be shared with payment service providers, the Eurosystem or any providers of supporting services."

The digital euro would have **legal tender status** with mandatory acceptance requirements, basic services **provided free of charge to users**, and pay **no interest on holdings**. Holding limits remain under development, with the ECB working to calibrate limits balancing user experience against monetary policy and financial stability implications, including bank disintermediation risk.

ECB leadership has made remarkably direct statements identifying dollar stablecoin dominance as monetary sovereignty threat. ECB Chief Economist Philip R. Lane stated in March 20, 2025: "The digital euro is also an effective tool to limit the dominance of foreign digital currencies, including the monetary sovereignty risks created by widely-adopted foreign-currency stablecoins." He warned of "digital dollarisation" and stated: "For the euro area, the erosion of monetary sovereignty would also have a historic symbolic meaning. Such an erosion would affect the euro as a symbol of European identity and the perceived cohesion of the entire monetary system."

ECB President Christine Lagarde's July 2, 2025 Sintra statement warned that technology-enabled confusion "risks undermining our capacity to conduct monetary policy" and "risks weakening the sovereignty of those countries." Most strikingly, she stated: "My concern is that this confusion leads to the **privatization of money**." The ECB blog post "From hype to hazard: what stablecoins mean for Europe" published July 28, 2025, articulated: "Should US dollar stablecoins become widely used in the euro area – whether for payments, savings or settlement – the ECB's control over monetary conditions could be weakened."

European banking industry opposition centers on deposit disintermediation. The European Banking Federation's June 16, 2022 response stated: "There is a significant risk for banks due to the potential shift of significant funds that are currently held as bank deposits to digital euro accounts/wallets." EBF commissioned Copenhagen Economics December 2023 study finding "CBDC could increase the speed and magnitude of bank runs in a situation of stress."

## Stephen Miran's Treasury funding framework omits explicit stablecoin proposals

Stephen Miran's November 2024 paper "A User's Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System" (41 pages, Hudson Bay Capital) presents a comprehensive framework for addressing dollar overvaluation and trade deficits but **does not explicitly mention stablecoins, tokenized treasuries, or digital instruments as alternative Treasury funding mechanisms**. This represents a widespread misattribution in subsequent commentary.

The **only cryptocurrency mention** appears on page 37: "alternative reserve assets like gold or cryptocurrencies will likely benefit"—treating cryptocurrencies as **alternatives to rather than supporters of** the dollar system, opposite of how stablecoins function. The connection between Miran's framework and stablecoins appears in **subsequent analyst commentary** by Rebecca Patterson (Council on Foreign Relations), Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee reports, and Atlantic Council analysis—not in Miran's original work.

Miran's actual framework focuses on **foreign central banks**: the "Mar-a-Lago Accord" would require them to **sell some dollar reserves** (strengthening their currencies), **convert remaining holdings into ultra-long bonds** (potentially century bonds), and receive **Fed/ESF swap lines** providing liquidity. The alternative IEEPA user fee proposal would withhold portions of interest payments on foreign official Treasury holdings. Miran stated in early 2025 that these policies "are expressly not on the Trump administration's agenda," suggesting his November paper represented exploratory analysis rather than official policy.

Researchers should cite stablecoin Treasury holdings through Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee data ($120 billion combined, projected $1.2 trillion by 2030 per Citi) and industry attestation reports rather than attributing this policy proposal to Miran.

## Trump administration implements coordinated pro-stablecoin, anti-CBDC strategy

The Trump administration established the most explicitly pro-cryptocurrency policy stance in U.S. government history. At the Bitcoin 2024 Conference in Nashville on July 27, 2024, Trump declared: "This afternoon, I'm laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet." He explicitly connected policies: "There will never be a CBDC while I'm president of the United States," followed by commitment to "create a framework for the expansion of stablecoins, which will extend the dominance of the U.S. dollar."

Trump's Portsmouth, New Hampshire rally on January 17, 2024, established his CBDC opposition rationale: "Such a currency would give the federal government, our government, the absolute control over your money. They could take your money, and you wouldn't even know it was gone." Executive Order "Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology," signed January 23, 2025, codified this dual policy, listing consecutively: promoting "development and growth of lawful and legitimate dollar-backed stablecoins worldwide" and "protect Americans from the risks of Central Bank Digital Currencies."

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, confirmed January 27, 2025, stated: "Crypto is about freedom and the crypto economy is here to stay." At July 30, 2025 launch, Bessent declared: "November 4, 2024, was America's Hard Fork on digital assets. The Golden Age of Crypto the President has ushered in stands in stark contrast to recent history." SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins, confirmed April 9, 2025, created "Crypto Task Force," rescinded Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, and stated the Working Group report "reflects a conviction that I have long held: a rational regulatory framework for digital assets is the best way to catalyze American innovation."

Congressional coordination demonstrates unprecedented alignment. The GENIUS Act passage—Senate (68-30, June 17), House (308-122, July 17), signed (July 18)—occurred during "Crypto Week" when House passed GENIUS Act, Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act consecutively. The stated rationale rests on three pillars: **dollar hegemony** (stablecoins expand dollar use globally), **freedom and privacy** (CBDCs enable government surveillance), and **private innovation versus government control** (market-driven solutions preferred).

## Treasury market stress episodes reveal structural vulnerabilities

Total outstanding Treasury securities reached **$28.1 trillion** as of December 2024, increasing $7.2 trillion from December 2020. Foreign holders control **$8.5 trillion (30% of publicly held debt)**, but foreign official holdings peaked in 2020 and have not significantly increased since 2013. While absolute foreign holdings increased from $7.3 trillion (2020) to $8.5 trillion (2024), the foreign share **declined from 35% to 30%**. Japan decreased holdings from $1.25 trillion (2020) to $1.06 trillion (2024), and China decreased from $1.07 trillion to $0.76 trillion.

The September 2019 repo market spike saw **Secured Overnight Financing Rate increase from 2.43% to 5.25%** with intraday rates reaching 10%. Aggregate reserves had declined to **less than $1.4 trillion by mid-September 2019** (down from $2.8 trillion peak). Federal Reserve response included repo operations offering up to **$75 billion** and October 2019 Treasury bill purchases at **$60 billion per month**. The crisis prompted establishment of Standing Repo Facility on July 28, 2021, providing permanent backstop with **$500 billion daily capacity**.

March 2020 Treasury market dysfunction saw bid-ask spreads in 30-year bonds increase to **five times normal levels**, with 10-year Treasury yields **rising 60 basis points** when they typically fall during stress. Customer transaction volumes spiked **50% to ~$650 billion/day**. Mutual funds executed net sales of **almost $200 billion in Q1 2020**. Federal Reserve purchases reached approximately **$1.6 trillion Treasuries and $700 billion agency MBS** (March-June 2020).

Lorie Logan's March 2023 speech warned: "The U.S. financial system has become increasingly vulnerable to core market dysfunction because the supply of intermediation has not kept pace with demand as the Treasury market's size and complexity have grown." She documented that "Treasury debt held by the public rose from 35 percent of GDP at the end of 2007 to about 95 percent of GDP in late 2022" while "primary dealers...have not increased the balance sheet devoted to Treasury holdings and Treasury repurchase agreements (repos) since 2007—even in nominal terms."
