# The architecture of inevitable crisis: European Monetary Union design flaws, 1991-1992

The European Monetary Union, formalized through the Maastricht Treaty signed February 7, 1992, embedded design flaws that made peripheral country debt crises structurally inevitable. Contemporary economists warned explicitly of these dangers, yet policymakers proceeded with a monetary union lacking the institutional architecture to sustain asymmetric shocks.

## Maastricht's arbitrary criteria and institutional gaps

The Treaty established convergence criteria with no solid theoretical foundation. The 60% debt-to-GDP ratio "approximated the average debt-to-GDP ratio of the 12 countries negotiating the Treaty" in 1989-1991, while the 3% deficit criterion derived from simple arithmetic: assuming 5% nominal GDP growth, a 3% deficit would stabilize debt at 60%. As Marco Buti and Vitor Gaspar, architects of the framework, later admitted: "These two reference values have no solid ground in either theory or empirical evidence. No such claim was made at the time (or ever)."

More critically, Maastricht created what Yanis Varoufakis termed "Perfectly Separable Sovereign Debts" while explicitly banning the ECB from acting as lender of last resort. **Article 125 TFEU (originally Article 104b) prohibited member states from assuming liabilities of others, while Article 123 TFEU banned the ECB from providing "overdraft facilities or any other type of credit facility...in favour of central governments."** This architectural choice, insisted upon by Germany's Bundesbank to prevent fiscal profligacy, fundamentally distinguished the eurozone from all other major currency unions. As Varoufakis documented: "The Eurozone was founded on two principles. The first principle was that its central bank would explicitly be banned from acting as a lender of last resort (for states and/or banks facing insolvency)."

## Contemporary warnings: economists predicted the trap

Prominent economists warned explicitly that this design invited crisis. In November/December 1997, Martin Feldstein published "EMU and International Conflict" in *Foreign Affairs*, predicting: "The adverse economic effects of a single currency on unemployment and inflation would outweigh any gains from facilitating trade and capital flows." Feldstein identified the core mechanism: asymmetric shocks without adjustment mechanisms would force unemployment as the only equilibrium restoration tool.

Wynne Godley's prescient 1992 analysis in the *London Review of Books* stated: "If a country or region has no power to devalue, and if it is not the beneficiary of a system of fiscal equalisation, then there is nothing to stop it suffering a process of cumulative and terminal decline." Godley explicitly warned: "If a government does not have its own central bank on which it can draw cheques freely, its expenditures can be financed only by borrowing in the open market in competition with businesses, and this may prove excessively expensive or even impossible, particularly under conditions of extreme emergency."

Rüdiger Dornbusch declared in *Foreign Affairs* (1996): "If there was ever a bad idea, EMU is it," warning that "by abandoning exchange rate adjustments it transfers to the labor market the task of adjusting for competitiveness...losses in output and employment will predominate." Even Robert Mundell's 1961 optimal currency area theory, which identified labor mobility and fiscal transfers as essential for successful monetary unions, suggested Europe was unsuitable—yet Mundell himself paradoxically became the euro's chief architect, shifting his position in 1973 papers that emphasized financial integration over labor mobility.

## The technical mechanism: how design made crisis inevitable

Paul De Grauwe's 2011 analysis clarified the precise mechanism: "When entering a monetary union, member countries change the nature of their sovereign debt in a fundamental way, i.e. they cease to have control over the currency in which their debt is issued. As a result, financial markets can force these countries' sovereigns into default." De Grauwe contrasted the UK (which controls sterling) with Spain: when UK investors sell gilts, "the pounds would remain bottled up in the UK money market...the UK government is ensured that the liquidity is around to fund its debt." But when Spanish investors sell government bonds, "the euros leave the Spanish banking system...The Spanish government experiences a liquidity crisis."

This created vulnerability to self-fulfilling panics. **Without a lender of last resort, eurozone members were "downgraded to the status of emerging economies"** that borrow in foreign currency. The absence of fiscal transfers compounded this: while the US federal system redistributes 25% of state-level shocks through automatic stabilizers, the EU budget represented merely 1% of GDP. Greece's only adjustment mechanism became internal devaluation—deflation and unemployment—without the option of currency devaluation that sovereign nations possess.

Varoufakis summarized: "If the Gold Standard experience of the 1920s taught us anything, it is that fixing exchange rates between economies whose capital utilisation and degree of oligopoly in their manufacturing sectors diverge significantly...is a recipe for large capital flows from surplus to deficit nations...It is as if the common currency's designers chose purposely not to heed the lessons of the dreadful mid-war era." The historical parallel is precise: Churchill's 1925 decision to return Britain to gold at $4.86 imposed deflation and unemployment as adjustment mechanisms, precisely as Tsipras's 2015 decision to remain in the euro imposed austerity. Both involved **fixed exchange rates without monetary sovereignty, forcing adjustment through unemployment rather than currency depreciation.**

The crisis required the ECB to violate its founding mandate. Mario Draghi's July 26, 2012 declaration—"Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro"—belatedly established the sovereign lender of last resort function that prudent design would have included from inception. Yet as Varoufakis noted, this came only "in exchange for being unshackled from the prohibition, the ECB had to commit to using its coercive powers in order to impose...the greatest austerity upon the weakest member states."

## Key quotable passages for manuscript

**On design's removal of shock absorbers:**
"The Eurozone...lacked the mechanisms that could contain a financial crisis in its midst...Under the principle of Perfectly Separable Debts, which defined the Eurozone's quasi-constitutional arrangements, and the fact that, uniquely in economic history, the Eurozone featured a Central Bank, the ECB, that lacked a mandate for acting as a lender of last resort either for the Eurozone's banks or for the sovereigns, the scene was set for a sequential bankruptcy of pairs of sovereigns and banking systems." (Varoufakis, 2013, p. 57)

**On sovereignty loss creating vulnerability:**
"In an important sense, Greece and Ireland found themselves in 2010 in the situation that Britain would have faced in 1931 if it had no currency of its own to un-peg from the Gold Standard and, instead, had to create one from scratch so as to devalue it many months later." (Varoufakis, 2013, p. 53)

**On self-fulfilling crises:**
"Members of a monetary union are very susceptible to liquidity movements. When investors fear some payment difficulty...liquidity is withdrawn from the national market (a 'sudden stop'). This can set in motion a devilish interaction between liquidity and solvency crises." (De Grauwe, 2011, p. 5)

**On the fiscal transfer gap:**
"In the US, cross state transfers via the tax system reduce tax collections by about 25 per cent of a shock...This is equivalent to Greece receiving additional transfers equal to roughly 4 per cent of GDP. This would amount to a transfer of €7.8 billion." (Feyrer & Sacerdote, 2013)

**On historical parallel:**
"Keynes believed that Winston Churchill, the Conservative chancellor who introduced the Gold Standard in 1925, was trying to force a recession on the UK to lower wages...'Deflation does not reduce wages automatically. It reduces them by causing unemployment.'" (Keynes, 1925, pp. 207-230)
