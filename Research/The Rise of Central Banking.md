The Rise of Central Banking
The earliest money and credit systems relied on coins, bullion, and merchant arrangements. In medieval
and early-modern Europe, wealthy merchants and goldsmiths held specie in vaults and issued receipts or
promissory notes for deposits. These notes, backed by gold, circulated as money when trusted (the London
goldsmith-bankers of the 1600s were famous for this) 1 2 . Merchants also used bills of exchange (tradecredit instruments) and powerful trading banks (e.g. Genoa’s Banco di San Giorgio or Amsterdam’s Bank of
1609) to settle payments without moving coin 3 . But these arrangements lacked a single sovereign
guarantor or lender-of-last-resort: money was still commodity-based and stability depended on local trust
and coinage policy rather than a unified authority.
The Bank of England’s headquarters in London. Founded in 1694, it was the model for many later central
banks.

Early Central Banks: England and France
The first true central banks appeared in the 17th–18th centuries to serve governments directly. Sweden’s
Riksbank (1668) and England’s Bank of England (1694) were set up as joint-stock companies to lend to
their governments and improve payments. The Bank of England, for example, was granted the
government’s balances and (by statute) the sole right to issue notes 4 . France’s Banque de France
(founded 1800 by Napoleon) was created to stabilize the currency after revolutionary hyperinflation and to
finance his wars 5 . These early central banks issued paper notes as currency under a de facto monopoly,
replacing much of the irregular coin and guild-credit system. In short, whereas medieval money was usually
sovereign coins or merchant notes, central banks centralized issuance: they kept government accounts,
guaranteed convertibility to specie (when in effect), and often acted as bankers’ banks (lender-of-last-resort)
to backstop payments 5 .

Money Issuance: From Gold to Fiat
Under early central banking (the classical gold standard), money was still convertible into metal. Each nation
fixed its currency to a weight of gold, and the central bank held gold reserves to back its note issue 6 . In
practice this meant strict convertibility: banks had to redeem notes in gold on demand, so the money
supply was constrained by gold reserves (the “nominal anchor” of the price level) 7 . Central banks’ priority
was therefore maintaining gold parity – a recipe for long-run price stability but little flexibility. During crises
(e.g. wars), convertibility was often suspended (Britain did so in 1797 and again in 1914, France during
1792–95) to let governments borrow freely.
After World War II, the Bretton Woods regime fixed exchange rates in dollars (with the US dollar
convertible to gold at \$35/oz) 8 . Central banks under Bretton Woods managed their currencies by
pegging to the dollar, maintaining reserves, and cooperating through the IMF. This anchored inflation at
first, but its rigidity meant the system unraveled when US deficits mounted. In 1971 the U.S. broke dollargold convertibility and by the mid-1970s most fixed pegs gave way to floating currency systems 9 . Since

then, almost all central banks have issued fiat money – currency with no commodity backing – and used
policy tools (interest rates, reserve requirements, open-market operations) to target price stability or
growth. (As one economist notes, “since Nixon’s decision to suspend dollar–gold convertibility in 1971, a system
of national fiat currencies has been used globally.” 10 .)

Central Banks and War Finance
A key impetus for central banks was wartime borrowing. For example, during the Napoleonic Wars the
Bank of England supported Britain by expanding credit to the government: it discounted large volumes of
government debt and private bills, effectively printing banknotes to finance the war effort 11 . (In fact,
England suspended gold convertibility in 1797 to do this.) Similarly, Napoleon used the Banque de France to
sell paper debt to fund his campaigns 5 .
In the 20th century, central banks again underwrote sovereign borrowing in war. When the U.S. entered
World War II, the Federal Reserve pledged to ensure “an ample supply of funds for financing the war
effort” 12 . The Fed worked with the Treasury to sell war bonds and even pegged interest rates: Reserve
Banks agreed to purchase Treasury bills at just 0.375% (and set the discount rate at 1%) to keep borrowing
costs low 13 . Similar policies were seen in other Allied countries. In effect, central banks monetized much
war debt (buying bonds directly) and coordinated bond drives. After each war, inflationary risks prompted a
return to stricter regimes (e.g. resuming gold convertibility, or later central bank independence), but the
wartime role of monetizing debt is a constant theme.
During World War II, central banks worked closely with finance ministries. The U.S. Federal Reserve
(building shown) helped market war bonds and pegged interest rates as part of the Allied war effort 12
13 .

Monetary Stability: Before vs After Central Banks
Before modern central banking, the monetary system was fragmented. In many countries (notably the U.S.
from 1837–1913), state-chartered banks issued their own notes with minimal oversight, leading to periodic
panics, worthless notes, and runs 14 15 . Governments borrowed in an ad-hoc way, sometimes defaulting
or debasing coinage. By contrast, after central banks emerged and matured, governments had a steady
source of credit (sellable bonds) and a mechanism to stabilize crises. Central banks provided a uniform
currency (eliminating competing state notes) and a lender-of-last-resort, reducing bank failures.
That said, central banks also had mixed records. In the classical gold era they sacrificed domestic growth
objectives for external stability (tie to gold) 7 , and their political independence varied. The experience
suggests trade-offs: after 1914 central banks increasingly emphasized employment and price stability,
whereas earlier their dominant mission was currency convertibility 16 . Overall, nations with central banks
generally developed more credible public debt markets (since a central bank could absorb debt if needed)
and smoother money supplies than the chaotic free-banking eras they replaced.

Monetary Regimes: Gold, Bretton Woods, Fiat
Under the Gold Standard (19th–early 20th c.), central banks constrained inflation but could not pursue
independent monetary policy. International gold flows automatically adjusted trade imbalances, but crises

(e.g. the Great Depression) exposed the system’s rigidity. During Bretton Woods, central banks again traded
flexibility for stability: they cooperated to maintain fixed rates until the U.S. abandonment of gold in 1971
9 . The dissolution of Bretton Woods led to the current era of fiat and often floating currencies. Central
banks now freely set policy (inflation targeting, macroprudential tools) but face exchange-rate volatility and
greater need for international coordination (through the IMF or currency unions).
Each regime shaped trade and credit: the gold and Bretton regimes anchored inflation expectations
internationally but limited countercyclical policy (and in practice contributed to deflation in the 1930s) 17
18 . The shift to fiat gave countries more domestic monetary autonomy (e.g. post-1970s inflation targeting)
but meant currencies became commodities subject to market speculation. Central banks thus moved from
simply preserving gold parity to actively managing currencies and credit, profoundly influencing the
evolution of money and international finance.
