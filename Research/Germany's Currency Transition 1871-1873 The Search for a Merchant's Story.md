# Germany's Currency Transition 1871-1873: The Search for a Merchant's Story

## Executive Summary

**Named individual found?** Partially — Gustav Godeffroy identified as the most promising candidate.

**Name:** Gustav Godeffroy  
**Location:** Hamburg  
**Business type:** Senator and partner in J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn, major Hamburg trading house; Chairman of Supervisory Board, Norddeutsche Bank (1856-1893)  
**Date range:** Active throughout 1871-1873; notably resigned from Senate in September 1872, one month before Hamburg's October 1872 currency decision

**Critical limitation:** While Godeffroy is documented as a major Hamburg merchant-senator active during the exact transition period with suspicious timing of his Senate resignation, no digitally accessible primary sources directly document his specific currency transition experiences with quantified losses or testimony.

## Individual Profile: Gustav Godeffroy

**Full name and dates:** Gustav Godeffroy (January 8, 1817, Hamburg - August 7, 1893, Hamburg)

**Business activities:**
- Partner in J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn (1842-1872), one of Hamburg's most prominent trading houses with 29 deep-water sailing vessels plus 100 smaller ships at peak
- Chairman of Supervisory Board, Norddeutsche Bank (1856-1893)
- Senate member (November 6, 1854 - September 10, 1872)
- President of Deputation for Direct Taxes (1862-1872)
- Coal mining investments in Westphalia, Prussia

**Relevant 1871-1873 activity:**
Godeffroy's voluntary resignation from Hamburg's Senate in September 1872 represents highly unusual timing for a lifetime position. This occurred precisely one month before the pivotal October 1872 decision when "the empire announced it would take 30 million Hamburg Marks from the Hamburg bank to ease the effect of the change and the Senate gave in." He immediately founded a new firm "Gustav Godeffroy" at the end of 1872, separating himself from the family trading house during the currency transition's most critical period.

His brother Johann Cesar VI. Godeffroy continued leading J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn, which entered bankruptcy proceedings in December 1879, attributed to "lack of liquidity" and "speculations with German mining stocks" in 1878. While bankruptcy documentation does not explicitly cite 1871-1873 currency losses, the firm's financial difficulties developed during a period that included both the currency transition (1873) and the Panic of 1873 financial crisis.

## Monetary Transition Context

**Hamburg's unique position:** Hamburg maintained independent currency systems — the mark courant (circulating currency) and mark banco (bank money) — creating complex conversion challenges distinct from Prussian thalers or South German gulden.

**Conversion specifics:**
- Hamburg mark courant converted at 1 mark = 1.2 German marks (16.7% devaluation)
- Hamburg mark banco converted at 1 mark banco = 1.5 German marks (50% appreciation)
- Official conversion date: February 15, 1873
- Transition period: Nearly two years until January 1, 1875, when old coins were withdrawn

**Political context:** Hamburg's mercantile elite fiercely resisted currency unification. The Hamburg Senate "had delayed the introduction of the new currency after the founding of the empire in 1871, because they feared that the new money would result in a further loss of Hamburg's sovereignty." Senator Gustav Heinrich Kirchenpauer, long-standing Hamburg envoy to the Federal Council, "fought for the special position of Hamburg" regarding currency independence before the Senate capitulated in October 1872 under financial pressure from the Empire's 30 million mark offer.

**Merchant opposition:** Contemporary sources note "the majority of Hamburg's wholesale merchants were opposed to joining the Customs Union and in favour of the maintenance of free trade. This camp included shipping companies, entrepot traders, overseas exporters, the importers of goods into Hamburg that would have been subject to duty in the Customs Union, such as coffee and tea." The Chamber of Commerce, stock exchange, and Senate "were all decisively for free trade."

## Alternative Candidates Identified

**William Henry O'Swald** (August 23, 1832 - May 7, 1923): Overseas merchant, partner in Wm. O'Swald & Co. (founded 1831), specializing in East Africa trade including Zanzibar headquarters, cowrie shell trade, palm oil, and textiles. Served as Senator 1869-1912 and Präses of Deputation for Trade and Shipping 1881-1912. Documented as participating in December 1880-January 1881 "informational discussions" with Prussian Finance Minister Karl Hermann Bitter regarding customs matters, demonstrating his active role in Hamburg's economic negotiations with Prussia.

**Johann Cesar VI. Godeffroy** (1813-1885): Head of J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn with extensive Pacific trade operations. Served in Hamburg Chamber of Commerce leadership including as Präses in 1845. His company's 1879 bankruptcy, while attributed to 1878 mining speculation, occurred during the aftermath of both the currency transition and the Panic of 1873.

Based on the Godeffroy family archive "considered lost for decades," including letters from five generations. Available as e-book for €12.99. Book description attributes bankruptcy to "intrigues and politics" but would require full-text search for any currency conversion mentions.

Ernst Baasch, *Die Handelskammer zu Hamburg 1665-1915*, 3 volumes (Hamburg: L. Gräfe & Sillem, 1915). Volume 2 covers 1814-1915 including the currency transition period. Freely available on Internet Archive at https://archive.org/details/diehandelskamm0201baasuoft but in German language.

**Primary sources requiring physical archive access:**

Staatsarchiv Hamburg, Handelskammer Hamburg Jahresberichte (annual reports) 1871-1873. Would contain merchant testimony, Chamber proceedings, and economic reports from the currency transition period. Archive located at Kattunbleiche 19, 22041 Hamburg, with online catalog at https://actapro-benutzung.hamburg.de (descriptions only; documents require on-site viewing).

*Hamburgischer Correspondent* newspaper 1871-1873. Digitized through Europeana Newspapers Project and searchable at http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu/. This was Hamburg's most famous political newspaper with Europe's highest circulation. The 1862 merger with *Hamburgische Börsenhalle* (business publication founded 1805) means it would contain extensive business news, currency transition announcements, Chamber of Commerce reports, and merchant activities.

Hamburg Address Books (*Hamburgisches Adressbuch*) 1871-1873. Fully digitized and freely accessible online at https://agora.sub.uni-hamburg.de/subhh-adress/digbib/start. These comprehensive directories list all Hamburg merchants with addresses, occupations, and business types for the exact years of currency transition.

**Archival research conducted by historians:**

Staatsarchiv Bremen contains reports by Hugo Wolff, an economic spy who provided information about Godeffroy's worldwide activities. Historian Gabriele Hoffmann accessed these reports, which explain "how a tycoon like Godeffroy had to stop payments" through "intrigues and politics." These reports do not mention currency losses in available descriptions.

**Secondary sources with limited individual case studies:**

Johannes Wiegand, "Destabilizing the Global Monetary System: Germany's Adoption of the Gold Standard in the Early 1870s," IMF Working Paper No. 2019/032 (February 2019). Available at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2019/WPIEA2019032.ashx. This 28-page analysis provides excellent macro-level understanding of policy debates and economic consequences but focuses on policymakers (Adolf Soetbeer, Ludwig Bamberger) rather than merchants experiencing financial impact. Cites primary sources including Soetbeer's publications and Bamberger's speeches, but contains no individual merchant case studies.

## Evidentiary Assessment

**What is certain:**
- Gustav Godeffroy was a prominent Hamburg merchant-senator and partner in J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn during 1871-1873
- He voluntarily resigned from Senate in September 1872, precisely during the currency transition debate
- Hamburg's Senate resisted currency conversion until October 1872 when the Empire offered 30 million Hamburg Marks as compensation
- Hamburg mark courant holders experienced effective devaluation (1:1.2 conversion ratio)
- The J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn trading house entered bankruptcy in 1879
- Multiple named Hamburg merchants and senators were active and documented during this period

**What is probable:**
- Godeffroy's September 1872 Senate resignation timing suggests possible connection to currency transition pressures
- Major Hamburg merchants holding contracts or assets denominated in mark courant would have experienced losses from the 1:1.2 conversion
- Gustav Godeffroy's immediate founding of a separate firm "Gustav Godeffroy" in late 1872 suggests strategic repositioning during the transition
- The 1879 bankruptcy of J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn developed during the aftermath of both currency transition and the Panic of 1873

**What gaps remain:**
- No digitally accessible primary source directly quotes Godeffroy on currency transition experiences
- No Chamber of Commerce testimony from Godeffroy specifically about currency losses is available online
- The 1879 bankruptcy documentation attributes failure to 1878 mining speculation and "intrigues," not explicitly to 1871-1873 currency losses
- Financial records, business ledgers, or correspondence showing quantified currency conversion impacts are not digitally accessible
- The definitive company history by Richard Hertz (1922) covering the exact period is not available online

## Alternative Approaches

**Option A — Composite merchant based on aggregate data:**

While no single merchant with complete documentation was found, extensive research reveals the structural conditions Hamburg merchants faced. A historically accurate vignette could be constructed using the verified conversion ratios (mark courant at 1:1.2), documented merchant opposition to currency unification, the October 1872 Senate capitulation, and the economic context of the Panic of 1873. This approach would require clearly labeling the merchant as representative rather than individually documented.

**Option B — Well-documented firm alternative:**

J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn represents the best-documented Hamburg trading house with activity through 1871-1873 and bankruptcy in 1879. Three major sources exist: Richard Hertz's 1922 company history (not digitally accessible), Gabriele Hoffmann's 2000 family history using private archives (available for purchase), and Ernst Baasch's Hamburg Chamber of Commerce history (freely available in German). The firm's scope (29 deep-water vessels, Pacific trade, copra plantations), its principals' documented roles (Gustav as Senator, Johann Cesar VI as Chamber of Commerce president 1845), and the bankruptcy timeline create a compelling narrative framework, though explicit currency loss documentation remains unavailable digitally.

**Option C — Physical archive research required:**

The most promising path to finding explicit merchant testimony would be:

**Priority 1:** Visit Staatsarchiv Hamburg to access Handelskammer Hamburg Jahresberichte 1871-1873 and Protokolle der Plenarsitzungen (Chamber proceedings). These records would contain merchant testimony, petitions, and complaints about currency conversion.

**Priority 2:** Search digitized *Hamburgischer Correspondent* 1871-1873 through Europeana Newspapers for German-language articles using search terms "Godeffroy," "Währungsumstellung," "Thaler," "Mark," and "Handelskammer."

**Priority 3:** Purchase or access Richard Hertz's 1922 definitive company history of J.C. Godeffroy & Sohn through academic libraries or specialized booksellers.

**Priority 4:** Purchase Gabriele Hoffmann's e-book (€12.99) and search for "Währung," "Thaler," "Mark," "1871," "1872," "1873."

**Option D — Secondary sources with strong archival citations:**

The Hamburg Address Books (1871-1873) freely accessible at https://agora.sub.uni-hamburg.de/subhh-adress/digbib/start provide a complete directory of Hamburg merchants during the exact transition period. Combined with Ernst Baasch's Chamber of Commerce history (freely available on Internet Archive) and the Wiegand IMF paper's analysis of policy impacts, a well-sourced narrative using indirect evidence could meet Tier 3 documentation standards ("academic case study with archival citations").

## Historiographical Gap Analysis

This research reveals a significant gap in the historiography of Germany's 1871-1873 monetary transition. The existing academic literature focuses overwhelmingly on macro-economic analysis (Wiegand's game theory approach, aggregate money supply impacts), policy debates (bimetallism versus gold standard), and political economy (Bismarck's strategic calculations). Individual merchant experiences — the microeconomic impact on specific businesses, documented losses from currency conversion, testimony from Chamber of Commerce proceedings — remain essentially absent from English-language scholarship and are minimally accessible in digitized German sources.

This gap exists because business historians have focused on institutional development of banks and industrial firms rather than merchant experiences, while monetary historians have emphasized policy-level analysis. The primary sources documenting individual merchant impacts (Chamber proceedings, business correspondence, account books, family papers) reside in physical archives in Hamburg, Bremen, and Frankfurt, with limited digitization.

## Recommendation for Chapter 6 Vignette

**Most defensible approach:** Use Gustav Godeffroy with careful qualification. Present him as a documented Hamburg merchant-senator active during the transition whose September 1872 resignation occurred during the crucial currency debate, followed by strategic restructuring through founding a new firm. Explicitly acknowledge that while his existence, position, and timing are documented through multiple sources including Wikipedia entries citing *Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie* and scholarly works, the specific documentation of his currency transition experience requires archival research in Hamburg.

Frame the vignette around the documented October 1872 decision when Hamburg's Senate capitulated to currency unification, using Godeffroy as a representative figure of Hamburg's mercantile elite who navigated this transition. The conversion ratio (1 mark courant = 1.2 German marks), the resistance narrative (Senator Kirchenpauer "fought for the special position of Hamburg"), and the economic context (30 million mark compensation, Panic of 1873) are all well-documented.

This approach maintains citation integrity by clearly distinguishing between what is documented (Godeffroy's existence, position, timing, business activities) and what requires inference (his specific currency experiences). A footnote could acknowledge the limitation: "While Godeffroy's commercial activities and Senate resignation during the currency transition are documented in multiple biographical sources, his specific experiences with currency conversion would require archival research in Hamburg's Staatsarchiv for definitive documentation."

**Alternative if stronger documentation is required:** Commission German-speaking researcher to access Staatsarchiv Hamburg and search the 1871-1873 Chamber of Commerce proceedings for specific merchant testimony with names and quantified losses, or purchase Richard Hertz's 1922 company history for detailed coverage of the Godeffroy firm's financial situation during these years.
