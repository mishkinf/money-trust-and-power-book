# Comprehensive Monetary History Research Report

## Executive Summary

This research addresses 17 specific topics across seven priority areas to strengthen your monetary history manuscript. The findings provide 2,000-3,000 words of substantive Bretton Woods detail, metallist counterarguments for intellectual rigor, specific technical mechanisms with quantitative data, and concrete historical examples with dates, names, and quotations throughout.

## PRIORITY 1: Bretton Woods System Expansion

### Dollar-Gold Convertibility in Practice

**Critical Asymmetry**: Only foreign central banks and governments could convert dollars to gold at $35/oz—not private parties. This "exorbitant privilege" (Giscard d'Estaing) was the system's foundation.

**Conversion Examples**:
- **France (1965-1967)**: Following de Gaulle's February 4, 1965 press conference, France aggressively converted. Between 1962-1966, France reduced dollar reserves by $2.8 billion of total $3.3 billion US gold decline. Gold shipped from Federal Reserve Bank of New York to Banque de France.
- **Spain (1964-65)**: Exchanged $60 million for gold—"biggest transaction of Franco era"
- **Britain (August 11, 1971)**: Requested $3 billion transfer four days before Nixon closed gold window. Paul Volcker: "If the British...were going to take gold for their dollars, it was clear the game was indeed over."

### The Triffin Dilemma: Quantitative Evidence

Robert Triffin's 1959-60 Congressional testimony predicted that once "outstanding dollar liabilities to the rest of the world would eventually exceed the US monetary gold stock," a "classic bank run" would occur.

**Critical Data Series**:
- 1949-50: $24.6 billion gold reserves (peak)
- 1958: Overall US external liabilities first exceeded gold stock
- 1962: Liabilities to officials (with eurodollars) exceeded gold
- 1964: $15.5 billion reserves vs. liabilities excluding eurodollars (ratio ~1:1)
- 1966: $13.2 billion reserves vs. $14 billion central bank dollar holdings (ratio 0.94:1)
- March 1968: $10.7 billion (crisis low)
- August 15, 1971: ~$10 billion vs. $80 billion foreign liabilities (ratio 0.125:1)

### London Gold Pool Crisis Management

**Formation (November 1, 1961)**: Eight central banks contributed 240 metric tons ($270 million). US: 50% ($135 million); seven European central banks split remainder. Bank of England executed all transactions.

**Operations**: Sold gold when London price approached $35.20 (upper export point); bought when weakened. Price target: $35.08-$35.20.

**Performance**:
- 1962-1965: Cumulative surplus $1,437 million in purchases
- 1965-March 1968: Cumulative deficit $3,692 million
- June 1967: France withdrew; US share rose from 50% to 60%
- November 1967-March 1968: Lost nearly $3 billion in 5 months
- March 14-15, 1968: Emergency closure; Queen declared bank holiday
- March 16-17, 1968: Washington meeting; Pool disbanded

### Two-Tier Gold Market (1968-1971)

**Established**: March 17, 1968 Washington communiqué

**Structure**:
- **Official tier**: $35/oz fixed for central bank transactions only
- **Private tier**: Free-market pricing; reopened April 1, 1968 at $38/oz (8% premium); peaked May 21 at $42.60/oz

**Three Key Conditions**: (1) Monetary authorities trade gold only at $35/oz, (2) Supply no gold to private markets from official stocks, (3) Buy little/no gold from private sellers

### IMF Role and Devaluation Cases

**British Pound (November 18, 1967)**:
- Previous parity: $2.80/£1 (since 1949)
- New parity: $2.40/£1
- Magnitude: 14.3% devaluation
- Announced: Saturday 9:30 PM by Chancellor James Callaghan
- Context: £800 million inherited deficit; £4.5 billion overseas sterling balances creating vulnerability
- IMF loan: £1.4 billion (November 29, 1967) with deflationary conditions
- Wilson's controversial broadcast (November 19): "the pound here in Britain, in your pocket or purse...has been devalued" [widely mocked]

**French Franc Multiple Devaluations**:
- January 1948, 1949 (350 francs/dollar), December 1958 (493.7 francs/dollar under de Gaulle/Rueff), August 11, 1969 (11% devaluation post-1968 protests)

**German Revaluations**: 1961, October 1969; May 1971 float (left Bretton Woods 3 months before Nixon)

## PRIORITY 2: Metallist Counterarguments

### Post-2000 Academic Critiques

**Limited peer-reviewed metallist defenses found**. Strongest critiques come from Austrian School and textbooks rather than mainstream journals.

**Julio Huato** (St. Francis College, *Science & Society*): Identified contradictions in Graeber's *Debt*—page 21 claims "money and debt appeared simultaneously" vs. page 40 "debt appeared first." Argues "myth of barter" is "not an absurd fantasy."

**Jeffrey Rogers Hummel** (San Jose State): Found "several serious conceptual confusions" in Graeber, representing Austrian/libertarian perspective.

### Austrian School's Strongest Arguments

**Carl Menger (1892)** "On the Origins of Money" (*Economic Journal*):
> "We can only come fully to understand the origin of money by viewing it as the spontaneous outcome, the unpremeditated resultant, of particular, individual efforts of the members of a society, who have little by little worked their way to a discrimination of the different degrees of saleableness in commodities."

**Ludwig von Mises (1912)** *Theory of Money and Credit*—**The Regression Theorem**:
> "Money must have originated in this fashion—on the market—with individuals gradually beginning to use some previously valuable commodity as a medium of exchange."

**Key Insight**: Money's current value traces back to yesterday's purchasing power, ultimately to last day of barter when commodity (gold/silver) had only commodity value. This **logically proves** money MUST originate from commodity with prior use-value—cannot emerge from government fiat or pure credit. This is the strongest metallist argument—credit theory has no answer to the "value bootstrapping" problem.

### Numismatic Evidence

**Martin J. Price** (Cambridge, 1983) "Thoughts on the Beginnings of Coinage":
> "These first coins were worth more than anything you could buy with them, and therefore, they were probably given to mercenaries as honor awards...more like a Purple Heart than a silver dollar."

Challenges both metallist and chartalist narratives—suggests symbolic/military functions.

### Mesopotamian Alternative Interpretations

**Silver as Proto-Money**: Oriental Institute notes "adoption of a silver standard that equated measures of barley with a set amount of silver." Physical artifacts: "spiral coil of silver, lengths of which were snipped off to pay debts."

**Denise Schmandt-Besserat**: 8,162 clay tokens representing "specified quantity of a particular commodity"—each token = specific amount of specific good.

**Metallist Response**: Even temple "credits" were claims on actual stored commodities, not pure abstractions. Weight-based measures (shekel = unit of weight) indicate commodity foundation. Convertibility requirement means temple "money" differed fundamentally from pure fiat.

## PRIORITY 3: Peacetime Monetary Innovation

### Amsterdam Wisselbank (1609)

**Established**: January 31, 1609 by Amsterdam city council

**Problems Solved (Non-War)**:
- 500+ different coins circulated with no reliable exchange system
- Coin debasement via Gresham's law
- Commercial inefficiency from foreign currencies
- VOC stock market (1602) settlement needs

**Revolutionary Innovations**:
- **Bank money (banco guilder)**: Stable unit based on fixed silver content (10.16g fine silver) with 4-5% premium (agio) over physical coins
- **Book-entry transfers**: Modern cheque/direct debit system—no physical coins needed
- **Receipts system (1683)**: Tradable receipts for bullion deposits (early fiat money/hedging)
- Made Dutch guilder de facto European reserve currency 17th-18th centuries

**Operations**: Law mandated all bills over 600 florins settled through Wisselbank. Deposits grew from ~1 million florins (early 1610s) to 8 million (1640s). Peak: 2,918 accounts (1721); 26 million guilders metal stock (1722).

**Decline**: 1790 declared insolvent after large unsecured VOC/government loans; 1820 closed.

### Swedish Riksbank (1668)

**Established**: September 17, 1668 as "Riksens Ständers Bank" (renamed Sveriges Riksbank 1866). **World's oldest surviving central bank**.

**Context**: Preceded by Stockholms Banco (1656) which became Europe's first bank to print banknotes (1661) but collapsed 1664-67 from over-issuance. Johan Palmstruch condemned to death (later clemency).

**Problems Solved**:
- Swedish copper coins weighing up to 45 pounds (extreme inefficiency)
- Bank stability after Stockholms Banco failure
- Prevent royal interference—placed under Riksdag control (parliament, not king)

**Innovations**: Initially prohibited from issuing banknotes (lesson learned); 1701 permitted "credit-notes"; mid-18th century established own paper mill (Tumba Bruk) for counterfeiting prevention; 1897 Riksbank Act gave exclusive note-issue right.

**Modern Firsts**: 2009—first central bank to implement negative interest rates (repo 0.25%, deposit -0.25%); pioneering e-krona (CBDC) research from 2016.

### European Payments Union (1950-1958)

**Established**: September 19, 1950 by OEEC; operations retroactive to July 1, 1950. **Duration**: 8 years, 6 months.

**Post-War Context**:
- West Germany GDP at 1908 level; France at 1891 level
- Severe dollar shortage—only acceptable reserve currency
- Bilateral payment gridlock; some trade reduced to barter
- Intra-European trade expanded much less than industrial output

**Ingenious Mechanics**:
- Each member reported bilateral deficits/surpluses to **BIS in Basel monthly**
- BIS calculated aggregate position vs. EPU as whole (not individual countries)
- **Transformed bilateral to multilateral trade**—offsetting debts/credits across countries

**Graduated Settlement Ratios ("Progressive Hardening")**:
- Deficit 0-20% quota: 100% credit, no payment required
- 20% quota: 20% settlement in gold/dollars
- 40% quota: 40% settlement
- 60% quota: 60% settlement
- 80% quota: 80% settlement
- Beyond quota: 100% settlement

US economist Raymond Vernon: "The underlying principles were clear; there was to be a free credit swing, and then a little bit of pain, and then a little more pain, and then a lot more pain."

**Success**: Intra-European trade more than doubled (1950-1958). Dissolved December 27, 1958—succeeded because goal achieved: full current account convertibility.

## PRIORITY 4: MMT Historical Precedents

### Adam Smith (1776) Proto-Chartalist Insight

*The Wealth of Nations*:
> "A prince, who should enact that a certain proportion of his taxes should be paid in a paper money of a certain kind, might thereby give a certain value to this paper money; even though the term of its final discharge and redemption should depend altogether on the will of the prince."

Directly anticipates MMT's "taxes drive money" principle—state-imposed tax obligations create demand for otherwise worthless fiat currency.

### Thomas Attwood (1783-1856) Birmingham School

Argued "Britain should have a paper currency which was not tied to gold" and "government should counter economic depressions by increasing the money supply." Focused on "gold standard and its inhibitory effect on growth of economy." Through Birmingham Political Union (1830), connected monetary reform to political reform—Parliament needed representatives understanding paper credit expansion could cure unemployment.

Benjamin Disraeli dismissed as "provincial banker labouring under financial monomania," but Attwood anticipated countercyclical fiscal policy decades before Keynes.

### Banking School (1840s)

**Thomas Tooke (1790-1858) and John Fullarton (1780-1849)** opposed Currency School's rigid metallism. Believed "real bills, needs of trade and law of reflux should govern bank operations." Theory that "banks first create money through loans" (not lending existing deposits) directly anticipates MMT's endogenous money creation.

Argued "from point of view of entrepreneurial debtors" vs. "rentiers and creditors"—anticipating MMT's focus on full employment rather than protecting creditor interests.

### Henry Thornton's 1802 *Paper Credit*

**On monetary contraction dangers** (p. 124):
> "it may be hoped, however, that at least one point has now been fully and completely established, namely, that there may be an error on the side of too much diminishing bank notes, as well as on the side of too much increasing them."

Stressed "danger that sudden deflationary measures could lead to falling production and unemployment."

**On government spending**: Francis Horner noted Thornton showed "loans to Government, in their direct operation, rather contributed to repair" money shortages "because notes were issued from Exchequer almost immediately into market."

**On velocity/deflationary spirals**: Discussed how people "hold money" reducing "rapidity of circulation" (monetary velocity), exacerbating contraction—anticipating deflationary spiral theory.

Friedrich Hayek called it "one of the most important works on money and banking in 19th century."

### Abba Lerner's Functional Finance (1940s)

**First Law** (1943):
> "The first financial responsibility of the government (since nobody else can undertake that responsibility) is to keep the total rate of spending in the country on goods and services neither greater nor less than that rate which at current prices would buy all the goods that it is possible to produce."

**On tax purposes**: Taxes used "for their economic impact, rather than to raise revenue"—directly anticipating MMT view that taxes control inflation and redistribute, not "fund" spending.

**"Money as a Creature of the State"** (1947):
> "Money is a creature of the state...it has to be managed."

Rejected "traditional doctrines of 'sound finance' and principle of trying to balance the budget"—these "make sense for individuals, households, businesses, and non-sovereign governments...but do not apply to governments of sovereign states, capable of issuing money."

**Keynes's Private Endorsement** (1943 letter): "I recently read an interesting article by [Abba] Lerner on deficit budgeting...His argument is impeccable. But, heaven help anyone who tries to put it across to the plain man at this stage of the evolution of our ideas."

### Beardsley Ruml (1946) Fed Chairman

**"Taxes for Revenue are Obsolete"**: Due to fiat currency, "government had no need for taxes in conventional sense of being used to pay government's US dollar-denominated bills."

**Four Purposes of Taxes**: (1) Stabilize purchasing power of dollar, (2) Express public policy in wealth/income distribution, (3) Subsidize/penalize industries, (4) Isolate and assess costs of national benefits.

## PRIORITY 5: Bretton Woods Negotiations (July 1944)

### Conference Structure

**Dates**: July 1-22, 1944, Mount Washington Hotel, Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. Originally scheduled to conclude July 19; extended 3 days. 730 delegates from 44 Allied nations—3x expected. Hotel closed since 1942, hastily reopened.

**Keynes's Description**: "Vast monkey-house at Bretton Woods" designed "so President can say 44 nations agreed." Warned (May 1944): "It would seem probable that acute alcoholic poisoning would set in before the end."

### The Decisive Moment: July 13, 1944

**A.D. Shroff** (Indian delegation) questioned meaning of "gold and gold-convertible exchange":
> "I think it is high time that the USA delegation give us a definition of gold and gold convertible exchange."

**Edward Bernstein** (US) replied:
> "Mr Chairman, it might be possible to give a definition...but it would involve a long discussion...it would be easier for this purpose to regard the United States dollar as what was intended when we speak of gold convertible exchange."

**Dennis Robertson** (British delegation) proposed text read: "payment of official gold and subscription should be expressed official holdings of gold and United States dollars."

**The Irony**: Not Americans but a fissure within British Empire (India seeking protection from sterling weakness) and a British economist (Robertson) who placed dollar at system's center—acknowledging only dollar had sufficient strength.

### Keynes vs. White: Specific Points of Contention

**1. Bancor vs. Dollar System**

**Keynes's International Clearing Union**:
- Supranational currency "bancor" (from "banque or"—bank gold)
- ICU as central bank for central banks
- Bancor defined in gold but value alterable by Union
- Gold exchangeable for bancor; **bancor NOT exchangeable for gold**
- Member countries with overdraft facilities—potentially unlimited credit
- All international trade valued/cleared in bancor

**White's Stabilization Fund**:
- Finite pool: $5 billion (raised to $8.5 billion at conference)
- No new international currency—use existing national currencies
- **US dollar as primary reserve currency**, convertible to gold at $35/oz
- Limited resources preventing unlimited credit expansion
- Subscriptions/quotas system (not clearing union)

**2. Burden of Adjustment**

**Keynes**: Symmetrical obligations—both surplus AND deficit countries bear responsibility. Surplus countries charged 5-10% interest on large excess credits; required to appreciate currencies. "Use-it-or-lose-it" mechanism preventing creditor hoarding.

**White**: Primary burden on deficit countries only. No penalties on surplus accumulation (critical—US expected major surplus). White to American delegation: "We have been perfectly adamant on that point. We have taken the position of absolutely no, on that."

**3. Exchange Rate Flexibility**

**British Position**: Greater flexibility, ease of altering exchange rates.

White to Morgenthau (June 1944, Atlantic City):
> "The British want to increase the flexibility and ease of alterations of exchange rates. We think we should not budge one bit."

**American Position**: More rigid system; changes only for "fundamental disequilibrium."

### Why Bancor Failed: Specific US Objections

**1. Unlimited Liability**
White feared ICU could create bancor at will; US (primary creditor) would accumulate vast bancor quantities while exporting real goods—essentially worthless paper.

White (August 1942):
> "There are some who believe that a universally accepted currency not redeemable in gold...is compatible with existence of national sovereignties....A little thought should, however, reveal the impracticability of any such notion."

**2. Creditor Nation Disadvantages**
US held 22 billion of world's reported 28 billion in gold (1943). Bancor system would drain this advantage.

New York World-Telegram (1943):
> "The kid who owns the ball is usually captain and decides when and where the game will be played...Since the U.S. now owns some twenty-two billions of the world's reported twenty-eight billions of gold, we think Uncle Sam is going to be the captain of the team or there will be no game."

### Compromises Offered and Rejected

**Offered**:
- Fund size increased from $5 billion to $8.5 billion
- "Scarce currency clause" allowing rationing and import restrictions
- Some exchange rate flexibility for "fundamental disequilibrium"
- World Bank (IBRD) for long-term development finance

**Rejected**:
- Bancor itself—completely rejected for dollar-gold system
- Unlimited credit—US refused open-ended mechanism
- Penalties on surplus countries—flatly rejected
- International governance—US insisted Washington location, effective veto
- Sterling area protection—forced eventual convertibility, end Imperial Preference

### Moments When Outcome Could Have Differed

1. **If Britain wasn't debtor**: Keynes acknowledged weak position due to £1.3 billion sterling balances owed to India/others—no leverage
2. **If preliminary negotiations failed**: Several near-breakdowns October 1943
3. **If Indian delegation hadn't forced definition**: Shroff's question made dollar's central role explicit
4. **If Roosevelt backed Keynes more**: But FDR fully supported Morgenthau/White

### Notable Quotes

**Keynes on signing** (December 1944):
> "We, all of us, had to sign, of course, before we had had a chance of reading through a clean and consecutive copy of the document. All we had seen of it was the dotted line. Our only excuse is the knowledge that our hosts had made final arrangements to throw us out of the hotel, unhouselled, disappointed, unaneled, within a few hours."

**White on US power** (to American delegation, July 1944):
> "Gold in Fort Knox is why the United States is in an enviable position...why we are in a powerful position in this Conference...why we dominate practically the financial world, because we have the where-with-all to buy any currency we want."

**Keynes-White Exchange** (October 1943):
Keynes: "This [American draft] is intolerable. It is yet another Talmud. We had better simply break off negotiations."
White: "We will try to produce something which Your Highness can understand."

## PRIORITY 6: Gold Standard Mechanics (1880-1914)

### Gold Points with Transaction Cost Precision

**Lawrence Officer's Research** (1890-1906 dollar-sterling):
- Gold point spread: Just above 1.0% of mint parity (down from ~5% in 1780s, ~2% in 1840s)
- Mint parity: $4.8665635/pound (fixed 1837-1931)

**Four Cost Components**:
1. Freight & insurance (Atlantic gold shipment)
2. Brassage/handling fees (bank conversion charges)
3. Interest costs (opportunity cost during 10-day voyage)
4. Abrasion (coin wear during shipment)

**Market Efficiency**: Only 4 months showed gold-point violations during entire 1890-1906 period. Zero violations 1925-1931.

**Specific Example: US Gold Crisis 1895-1896**
- January 1895: Treasury gold reserves draining due to silver monetization fears
- Morgan-Rothschild syndicate purchased $100 million government bonds at 104.5 (4.5% above face) when comparable bonds traded at 113.5
- Syndicate marketed bonds at 112.25 within 11 days
- Massive gold imports organized to US Treasury
- September-November 1895: Severely distorted Bank of England reserve relationships

**Timeframes**: Atlantic voyage ~10 days standard. Forward contracts typically 10-day maturity (vs. normal 30/60/90-day forwards).

### Bank of England Reserve Management with Minimal Reserves

**Structural Context** (Bloomfield study): English gold reserves to banking system demand liabilities: **less than 5%** (much lower than France, Russia, Austria-Hungary). Yet convertibility/sterling stability never seriously questioned.

**Baring Crisis (November 1890)—The Classic Case**

**Timeline**:
- November 8: Lord Revelstoke (Edward Baring) approached Governor William Lidderdale
- November 10: BoE gold reserves fallen to dangerous £10.8 million
- November 15: Rescue announced

**Actions**:
- £3 million gold loan from Banque de France (swap for Treasury bills)
- £1.5 million gold from Bank of Russia
- £7.5 million advance to Barings from BoE
- £4.5 million total international support replenished BoE reserves

**Political Dynamics**: Chancellor Goschen initially refused to "interfere on behalf of insolvent house," offered Chancellor's letter to suspend gold requirement. Lidderdale **refused**, fearing dual crisis (bank runs AND pound sterling). Instead negotiated international gold loans through Rothschild connections.

**Outcome**: Real GDP fell only 1.6% (1891-92), recovered by 1894. No systemic run.

**Panic of 1866 (Overend-Gurney Crisis)**

**May 10, 1866**: Overend, Gurney & Company declared insolvent.

**Bank Actions**:
- Bank Rate raised to **10%**
- **Held at 10% for 95 days**—"significantly longer than after previous crises"
- Lent freely but at punitive rates (Bagehot's principle)
- Used up 85% of accessible cash reserves
- Suspension of Bank Charter Act 1844 authorized but never actually implemented

**Political Pressure**: "Extended period of high rates caused public consternation about Bank's potential role in extending crisis"—Parliamentary/journalistic scrutiny.

**Outcome**: "Widely regarded as turning point in Bank's evolution towards modern central bank."

**Crisis of 1914 (War Outbreak)—Extreme Pressures**

**Timeline**:
- July 23: Austrian ultimatum to Serbia—markets crashed
- July 27-31: Foreign exchange and money markets broke down
- July 31: London Stock Exchange closed (stayed closed 5 months—unprecedented)
- August 1-3: Bank holiday extended to 4 days

**Bank Rate**: Raised from 3% to 4% to 8%; political authorities demanded **10%** as condition for suspending Bank Act. **10% implemented August 1, 1914**—highest rate in world.

**Crisis Dynamics**: Run on banks—depositors demanding gold sovereigns (£1 coins). Banks rationed gold, paid out £5 notes instead (equivalent £400 today—useless for transactions). Long queues at BoE to convert notes to gold. Newsboy arrested for shouting "Run on the Bank."

**Emergency Measures**:
- **"Bradburys"**: Treasury currency notes (£1 and 10 shilling) as paper substitute for gold sovereigns
- **General moratorium**: Legalized suspension of contracts to protect debtors/banks
- **Cold Storage Scheme (August 12)**: BoE bought £350m "derelict" pre-war bills under Treasury guarantee (almost 40% of money market)
- **Expanded Scheme (September 5)**: ~£200m loans to recapitalize banks (9% of GDP)

**Political Pressure—Extreme**: Governor **Walter Cunliffe** (described as "autocratic" and "a bully") refused Treasury direction. **1917**: Cunliffe tried to countermand Treasury orders about Canadian gold reserves. **Lloyd George threatened to "take over the Bank"** and presented statement for Cunliffe to sign.

Lloyd George to Parliament:
> "I think we have done for the banks as much as ever they could have expected...We did it to enable them to finance trade...If government is prepared to take risks, they [banks] must take risks as well."

**Outcome**: Banks hoarded liquidity—bankers' deposits at BoE tripled from £30m (August) to £105m (December). State intervention £200m = 9% of GDP (unprecedented). Gold standard technically maintained but gold unavailable to private citizens in practice.

**Panic of 1907**
- November 6: Sharp sell-off London Stock Exchange
- November 7: Bank Rate raised to **9%**
- Knickerbocker Trust collapse in NY triggered global contagion
- Gold exported to US beginning September 25

### Parliamentary Interventions

**Formal Actions**:
1. **Bank Charter Act 1844 Suspension Letters**: Used 1847, 1857; authorized but NOT used 1866, 1914. Required Chancellor letter promising Parliamentary ratification. Allowed note issue beyond legal gold cover.

2. **Parliamentary Scrutiny**: 1866—debates questioned prolonged high rates. Financial press extensively criticized Bank policies.

3. **Treasury-Bank Conflicts**: 1890—Goschen negotiations with Lidderdale. 1914-17—extreme conflict with Cunliffe. 1917—Lloyd George's nationalization threat.

**Informal Pressures**:
- 1914: Ministers "vociferously denounced hoarding of gold" in Parliament
- Coordinated press campaign against hoarding
- Times headline: "The Folly of Hoarding"
- Evening News: "All gold should be in banks and available for the state"

## PRIORITY 7: Real Bills Doctrine

### Adam Smith's Seductive Water-Pond Metaphor (1776)

*Wealth of Nations*, Book II, Chapter 2:
> "When a bank discounts to a merchant a real bill of exchange drawn by a real creditor upon a real debtor, and which, as soon as it becomes due, is really paid by that debtor; it only advances to him a part of the value which he would otherwise be obliged to keep by him unemployed and in ready money for answering occasional demands. The payment of the bill, when it becomes due, replaces to the bank the value of what it had advanced, together with the interest. The coffers of the bank, so far as its dealings are confined to such customers, resemble a water pond, from which, though a stream is continually running out, yet another is continually running in, fully equal to that which runs out; so that, without any further care or attention, the pond keeps always equally, or very nearly equally full."

**Smith's Distinctions**:
- **"Real bills"**: Legitimate commercial bills (60-90 days) backed by real goods in production/inventory
- **"Fictitious bills"**: Accommodation bills or bills without real commercial transactions

**"Fixed Channel of Circulation"**: Smith believed nominal money demand was inelastic:
> "The value of goods annually bought and sold in any country requires a certain quantity of money to circulate and distribute them to their proper consumers, and can give employment to no more. The channel of circulation necessarily draws to itself a sum sufficient to fill it, and never admits any more."

This concept was crucial but later refuted.

### Henry Thornton's 1802 Demolition

*An Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain* identified the doctrine's **fatal flaw—it ignored the rate of interest**:

> "In order to ascertain how far the desire of obtaining loans at the bank may be expected at any time to be carried, we must enquire into the subject of the quantum of profit likely to be derived from borrowing there under the existing circumstances...The bank is prohibited, by the state of the law, from demanding even in time of war, an interest of more than five per cent., which is the same rate at which it discounts in a period of profound peace."

**Two-Interest-Rate Model** (precursor to Wicksell):
> "At some seasons an interest, perhaps, of six per cent. per annum, at others, of five, or even four per cent., may afford that degree of advantage to borrowers which shall be about sufficient to limit, in the due measure, the demand upon the Bank for discounts...when the augmented quantity of paper shall have been for some time stationary, and shall have produced its full effect in raising the price of goods, the temptation to borrow at five per cent. will be exactly the same as before...the moderation and forbearance among borrowers, which were supposed likely to restrain the too great emission of paper, are only to be excited by the means of its perpetual encrease."

**Key Insight**: If market rate held constant while profit expectations rise, credit demand becomes unlimited → continuous monetary expansion and inflation.

**Thornton's Alternative Policy Rule** (p. 259):
> "To limit the total amount of paper issued, and to resort for this purpose, whenever the temptation to borrow is strong, to some effectual principle of restriction; in no case, however, materially to diminish the sum in circulation, but to let it vibrate only within certain limits; to afford a slow and cautious extension of it, as the general trade of the kingdom enlarges itself."

### The Bullionist Controversy (1797-1821)

**February 27, 1797**: British government suspended Bank of England's gold convertibility obligation (amid French invasion fears). "Temporary" suspension lasted until 1821—first major test of monetary theory under inconvertible paper.

**The Bullion Report (1810)**: House of Commons Select Committee (chaired Francis Horner, Henry Thornton prominent member) refuted Real Bills definitively.

**Bank Directors' Defense**: Mr. Pearse (Governor) asked if excess issue possible if discount rate dropped from 5% to 4% to 3%:
> "I conceive there would be no difference, if our practice remained the same as now, of not forcing a note into circulation."

**Report's Condemnation**: "Wholly erroneous in principle, and pregnant with dangerous consequences in practice" (p. 46).

**Theoretical Refutation** (pp. 50-51):
> "In the first instance, when the advance is made by notes paid in discount of a bill, it is undoubtedly so much capital, so much power of making purchases, placed in the hands of the Merchant who receives the notes...But as soon as the portion of circulating medium, in which the advance was thus made, performs in the hands of him to whom it was advanced this its first operation as capital, as soon as the notes are exchanged by him for some other article which is capital, they fall into the channel of circulation as so much circulating medium, and form an addition to the mass of currency. The necessary effect of every such addition to the mass, is to diminish the relative value of any given portion of that mass in exchange for commodities."

**Outcome**: Parliament rejected recommendations, voting against early resumption. Convertibility finally restored **1821**.

### Banking School vs. Currency School (1825-1844)

**Currency School** (Jones-Loyd/Overstone, Torrens, Norman): Money supply should fluctuate 1:1 with gold reserves.

**Banking School** (Tooke, Fullarton, Wilson): Defended status quo; emphasized **"Law of Reflux"**—any over-issue would automatically return to banks.

**Bank Charter Act of 1844 (Peel's Act)**: Currency School victory. Divided Bank of England into Issue Department (currency board) and Banking Department (normal bank). Notes backed 1:1 by gold (except fixed fiduciary issue).

**Tooke's Warning** (1844, pp. 107-109):
> "Under a system of separation...what would be the operation of a demand for export to the extent of three millions of gold? In all probability this demand would almost exclusively fall upon the deposit department...while the circulating department would still have six million of bullion, the deposit department would have no alternative to stop payment. A most absurd, however disastrous a state of things."

**Act suspended**: 1847, 1857, 1866 during crises—proving Banking School right about need for discretion.

### Federal Reserve Act Enshrines the Doctrine (1913)

**Section 13** defined eligible paper: Federal Reserve Banks could discount only "notes, drafts, and bills of exchange arising out of **actual commercial transactions**"—must be **self-liquidating** (not speculative), maximum 90-day maturity, excluding paper financing "investments of a purely speculative character."

**Purpose** (preamble): "To furnish an **elastic currency**" that would "accommodate commerce and business."

By discounting only real bills, money quantity would be: (1) geared to real production, (2) self-liquidating as goods sold, (3) non-inflationary by nature, (4) responsive to seasonal/cyclical credit demands.

Thomas Humphrey (1982): "This so-called commercial loan theory or real bills doctrine was a basic principle underlying the money functions of the new system."

### Great Depression Disaster (1929-1933)

**Fatal Role**: Adolph Miller (Fed Board member) launched "Direct Pressure" (1929)—requiring banks seeking discount window assistance to affirm no speculative loans (especially stock market). **Result**: No bank would undergo interrogation. Banks chose to fail rather than borrow from "hard-boiled" Fed.

**Real Bills Logic**:
- Stock market speculation = "speculative," not "productive"
- Doctrine said Fed should only support productive credit
- As production fell, "needs of trade" legitimately declined
- Therefore, monetary contraction was appropriate response to falling output
- This **procyclical** policy deepened Depression

**Statistics**: Nearly 9,000 banks failed (1930-33). Money stock contracted 1/3. Friedman/Schwartz: This monetary contraction caused Great Depression.

**Richard Timberlake** (2005): Gold standard did NOT cause Depression—**Real Bills Doctrine did**. Fed had ample gold reserves but ideology prevented using them.

**Ben Bernanke's 2002 Apology** (as Fed Governor):
> "Regarding the Great Depression. You're right, we did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again."

### Why People Believed: Self-Liquidating Loan Concept

**The Appeal**:
- Merchant borrows to buy inventory
- Goods move through production/distribution
- Goods sell to final consumer
- Sale generates cash to repay loan
- Loan "liquidates itself" with goods' sale
- Money supply contracts automatically as loan repaid

This seemed to ensure money creation tied to real production with automatic limitation on credit expansion.

**Why It Was Wrong—Fatal Flaw**: Real bills are **nominal** instruments. A bill for $1000 of wheat at $10/bushel = 100 bushels. If prices double, bill becomes $2000 for same 100 bushels. "Real bills" backing expands/contracts with price level—provides NO constraint on monetary expansion. Creates positive feedback loop: money → prices → more money.

**Thomas Humphrey's Three Main Flaws**:
1. **Price-quantity feedback loop**: Linking money to nominal value (P×Q) rather than real output (Q) created positive feedback
2. **False productive/speculative distinction**: All production involves uncertainty; cannot distinguish "real" from "speculative" in practice
3. **Procyclical policy**: Calls for expansion in booms and contraction in depressions—exactly opposite of stabilization policy

## OPTIONAL: 2008 Money Market Fund Crisis

### Reserve Primary Fund Collapse (September 2008)

**Pre-Crisis**: World's third-largest MMF with $62.5 billion assets. Held $785 million (1.2% of assets) in Lehman Brothers commercial paper/medium-term notes.

**September 15, 2008 (Monday)**:
- Early morning: Lehman files Chapter 11 bankruptcy
- 9:30 AM: Reserve Primary Fund board call; decides to change accounting from amortized cost to fair value
- 10:10 AM: State Street Bank (custodian) stops funding redemptions after honoring ~$10 billion, suspends overdraft privileges
- 1:00 PM: Board reconvenes; redemption requests total $16.5 billion
- End of day: Requests reach ~$20 billion, nearly half unfunded

**September 16 (Tuesday)**:
- By 3:45 PM: Unfulfilled requests surpass $30 billion
- Total redemptions exceed $40 billion (~2/3 of fund's AUM)
- 4:00 PM: Announces "broke the buck" with NAV $0.97/share (marked Lehman holdings to zero)
- Announces 7-day redemption delay for amounts over $10,000

**September 17 (Wednesday)**: Market-wide panic—investors withdraw $144.5 billion from MMF accounts. Treasury yields drop below zero.

**Overall Impact**: September 10-October 1, 2008: $439 billion withdrawn from prime MMFs; $362 billion flows into government-only funds.

### Treasury Guarantee Program

**Announced**: September 19, 2008 (Secretary Henry Paulson, Chairman Ben Bernanke)

**Legal Authority**: Gold Reserve Act of 1934 (as amended 1976), authorizing use of Exchange Stabilization Fund—$50 billion available.

**Operational**: September 29, 2008; enrollment deadline October 8, 2008.

**Coverage**: $3.2+ trillion MMF assets at peak (93% of market). 366 MMF management companies, 1,486 individual funds participated.

**Fee Structure**:
- Initial (Sept-Dec 2008): 1 basis point quarterly for NAV ≥ $0.9975 on Sept 19; 1.5 basis points for NAV ≥ $0.995 but < $0.9975
- Extension 1 (Nov 2008-Apr 2009): 1.5 basis points for NAV ≥ $0.9975; 2.2 for NAV ≥ $0.995 but < $0.9975
- Extension 2 (May-Sept 2009): 1.5 basis points (6-month) for NAV ≥ $0.9975; 2.3 for NAV ≥ $0.995 but < $0.9975

**Duration**: Original 3 months; extended to April 30, 2009; extended again to **September 18, 2009** (final expiration).

**Outcome**: Total fee revenue $1.2 billion. Claims paid $0 (no MMFs filed claims). **Taxpayer profit: $1.2 billion**.

### Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF)

**Announced**: September 19, 2008. **Began Operations**: September 22, 2008. **Closed**: February 1, 2010.

**Administrator**: Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (authorized for all 12 Fed Districts).

**Legal Authority**: Section 13(3) of Federal Reserve Act.

**Structure**: Non-recourse loans to banks to purchase asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) from money market mutual funds. Interest rate: Primary credit rate (fixed at loan origination). Loan amount: Equal to amortized cost of eligible ABCP pledged. Maturity: Equal to ABCP maturity date. Collateral: High-quality ABCP rated at least A1/P1/F1.

**Dollar Amounts**:
- First 10 days (late September 2008): $150 billion lent
- Peak outstanding (October 2008): $152 billion (21% of all outstanding ABCP)
- Total lending over program life: $217.435 billion
- Major participants: JP Morgan Chase and State Street Bank = 92% of AMLF intermediary borrowing

**Outcome**: All loans repaid in full with interest; **no losses** to Federal Reserve or taxpayers.

### Section 13(3): From Unlimited Powers to Constrained Authority

**Original Enactment**: July 21, 1932 via Emergency Relief and Construction Act (Great Depression).

**Original Requirements (1932-2010)**:
1. "Unusual and exigent circumstances" determined by at least 5 of 7 Fed governors
2. Broad lending authority: "discount for any individual, partnership, or corporation"
3. Collateral requirement: "notes, drafts, and bills of exchange endorsed or otherwise secured to satisfaction of Federal Reserve Bank"
4. No other source: Borrower must obtain evidence cannot secure adequate credit elsewhere

**2008 Crisis Usage**: Peak $710 billion outstanding (November 2008).

**Specific Facilities Created Under 13(3)**:
1. **Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF)**: March 16, 2008
2. **AMLF**: September 19, 2008; peak $152 billion
3. **Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF)**: October 7, 2008; peak $350 billion (January 2009)
4. **TALF**: November 25, 2008
5. **MMIFF**: October 21, 2008 (never used; closed October 30, 2009)
6. **Individual firm assistance (controversial)**: Bear Stearns (March 2008), AIG (September 16, 2008: $85 billion facility for 79.9% equity stake)

**All lending repaid in full with interest; no losses**.

### Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform (July 21, 2010)

**Final Regulations**: Federal Reserve Board approved November 30, 2015; effective January 1, 2016.

**Key Changes—What Was Restricted**:

**1. BROAD-BASED ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENT (NEW)**:
- Pre-Dodd-Frank: Could lend to "any individual, partnership, or corporation"
- Post-Dodd-Frank: May ONLY establish "programs or facilities with broad-based eligibility"

**Definition (2015 Final Rule)**:
- Must have at least FIVE (5) eligible participants
- Must provide liquidity to identifiable market or sector
- NOT designed to aid any specific company
- Specifically PROHIBITED: Programs structured to remove assets from single company's balance sheet or established to assist single company avoid bankruptcy/insolvency

**Impact**: Individual firm bailouts like Bear Stearns and AIG would NOT be permitted under amended 13(3).

**2. TREASURY SECRETARY APPROVAL REQUIRED (NEW)**:
Federal Reserve Board may NOT establish any 13(3) program without PRIOR approval of Secretary of the Treasury. Major shift—previously Fed could act independently in emergencies.

**3. PURPOSE RESTRICTIONS (NEW)**:
- Purpose must be "providing liquidity to financial system"
- Explicitly NOT to "aid a failing financial company"
- Must terminate programs "in timely and orderly fashion"
- If not further authorized, facility may not last more than 1 year

**4. INSOLVENCY PROHIBITION (ENHANCED)**:
Federal Reserve prohibited from lending to insolvent borrowers.

**Broad Definition of Insolvency (2015 Final Rule)**:
- In bankruptcy proceedings
- In resolution under Dodd-Frank Title II
- In any other federal or state insolvency proceeding
- Failed to pay undisputed debts as became due during 90 days prior to borrowing
- Determined by Board or Reserve Bank to be insolvent

**5. TAXPAYER PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS (NEW)**:
- Security for emergency loans must be "sufficient to protect taxpayers from losses"
- Federal Reserve Bank must assign "lendable value" to all collateral
- Must use "sound risk management practices"
- Lendable value assigned prior to or at time credit initially extended

**6. DISCLOSURE AND REPORTING (NEW)**:
- Detailed reports to Congressional committees within 7 days of authorization
- Public disclosure of borrower identity, amounts, terms, collateral:
  - For facilities: 1 year after facility authorization terminated
  - For transactions: 2 years after transaction
- Congressional Reporting: Regular updates required

**What Changed From 2008**:
- **2008**: Fed could independently create facilities; could assist individual firms (Bear Stearns, AIG); acted as sole decision-maker
- **2010+**: Fed needs Treasury approval; CANNOT assist individual firms; must have broad-based programs; enhanced disclosure; stricter insolvency tests

**Congressional Intent**: Balance crisis-fighting capability with prevention of moral hazard and protection of taxpayers. Maintain Fed's lender-of-last-resort function for markets while eliminating ability to bail out individual companies.
