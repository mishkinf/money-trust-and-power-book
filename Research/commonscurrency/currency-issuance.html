      <h1>Currency Issuance and Distribution Mechanism</h1>

      <p class="intro-text">The Commons Currency (referred to as "Commons Unit" or CU) will be a digital currency
        recorded on a global blockchain ledger. The issuance and distribution of CUs are engineered to promote fairness
        and global adoption while ensuring no country is disadvantaged by timing of participation.</p>

      <h2>Genesis Allocation to Nations</h2>

      <p>At the launch of the system, a fixed supply of Commons Units will be allocated to all countries of the world in
        predefined shares.</p>

      <h3>Equal Initial Shares</h3>

      <p><span class="highlight">One approach is to allocate an equal base share to each country from the genesis block,
          underscoring equality among nations.</span> For example, if 200 countries are considered, the genesis supply
        might be divided into 200 equal nation accounts.</p>

      <p>This equal allocation reflects the core principle of sovereignty regardless of economic size. A small island
        nation receives the same genesis allocation as the largest economy, reinforcing that Commons Currency is about
        democratic coordination, not economic dominance.</p>

      <h3>Escrow for Non-Participants</h3>

      <p>These genesis allocations remain reserved for each country to claim when they formally join the Commons system.
        <strong>If a country is initially not participating, its allocated CUs are held in escrow (unspendable) on the
          ledger.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>When countries opt in, they "claim" their share (through their delegate or central bank), bringing those units
        into circulation under that nation's control. This ensures no country is left behind; even smaller or
        late-joining nations are not disadvantaged in initial monetary resources.</p>

      <h2>Critical: Protecting Late-Joining Countries</h2>

      <p>A fundamental fairness mechanism addresses a critical challenge: <em>What happens to countries that haven't
          joined yet when active members make monetary policy decisions?</em></p>

      <h3>The Problem Without Protection</h3>

      <p>Imagine 100 countries join in Year 1, each receiving 1 million CU (100 million total in circulation). Over the
        next 5 years, these active members vote to expand the money supply by 5% annually to support global economic
        growth. By Year 5, the circulating supply is ~128 million CU.</p>

      <p>Now a 101st country joins in Year 5 and claims its genesis allocation of 1 million CU.
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Its 1 million CU is now worth only 0.78% of the total supply (1M / 128M), while the
        original 100 countries each have ~1.28 million CU (1.0% of supply). The late joiner has been diluted by 22%
        through no fault of its own.
      </p>

      <h3>The Solution: Proportional Adjustment</h3>

      <p><span class="highlight">When active member countries make monetary policy decisions (such as coordinated money
          supply expansion), the escrowed allocations of non-participating countries are proportionally adjusted to
          maintain their relative share.</span></p>

      <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Initial State:</strong> 200 countries each receive 1 million CU in genesis allocation (200 million
          total)</li>
        <li><strong>Year 1:</strong> 100 countries join and activate their allocations (100 million active, 100 million
          escrowed)</li>
        <li><strong>Year 2:</strong> Active members vote to expand money supply by 5% to support growth
          <ul>
            <li>All 200 allocations increase by 5%, including the 100 escrowed accounts</li>
            <li>Active countries now have 1.05 million CU each</li>
            <li>Escrowed accounts also now hold 1.05 million CU each</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Years 3-5:</strong> Further 5% annual expansions occur, each time adjusting ALL accounts
          <ul>
            <li>After 5 years of 5% annual growth, each account has ~1.276 million CU</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Year 5:</strong> A previously non-participating country joins
          <ul>
            <li>It claims its allocation—now worth 1.276 million CU</li>
            <li>It has the same relative share (0.5%) as countries that joined in Year 1</li>
            <li><strong>No dilution has occurred</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Smart Contract Enforcement</h3>

      <p>This mechanism is enforced through smart contracts that automatically adjust all accounts proportionally
        whenever the governance assembly approves money supply changes. <strong>No nation is penalized for timing of
          participation.</strong></p>

      <p><span class="highlight">The principle is simple: late-joining countries should receive their fair share of
          global monetary policy decisions made in their absence, preserving the fundamental equality of
          sovereignty.</span></p>

      <h2>National Issuance Rights and Guardrails</h2>

      <p>Nations have the ability to issue Commons currency aligned to their domestic economic needs—similar to how
        sovereign currencies function today, but with democratic global guardrails.</p>

      <h3>Quota-Based System</h3>

      <p>In practice, the governance assembly agrees on formula-based limits for each nation's net issuance, often
        inspired by Keynesian quotas:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Base quota:</strong> Each nation has a quota of Commons Units proportional to factors like trade
          volume, population, or economic capacity</li>
        <li><strong>Deficit tolerance:</strong> A country can issue CUs beyond its allocation up to a certain percentage
          without special permission</li>
        <li><strong>Assembly approval:</strong> Larger issuances require democratic assembly vote</li>
        <li><strong>Automatic mechanisms:</strong> Exceeding thresholds triggers trade rebalancing mechanisms (see <a
            href="trade-rebalancing.html">Trade Rebalancing</a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Preserving Fiscal Autonomy</h3>

      <p><span class="highlight">A country can expand its money supply for domestic investment (healthcare,
          infrastructure, education) up to agreed thresholds without requiring special permission.</span></p>

      <p>This preserves national fiscal autonomy—governments can create money for stimulus or investment at home—while
        protecting global stability through transparent, code-enforced boundaries.</p>

      <p><strong>See:</strong> <a href="fiscal-autonomy.html">Fiscal Autonomy & Monetary Coordination</a> for a deep
        dive into how Commons enables nations to be true currency issuers with the freedom to pursue domestic priorities
        without external debt crises.</p>

      <h3>Mission-Oriented Investment</h3>

      <p>Nations are encouraged to organize currency issuance around ambitious missions that solve real problems and
        build productive capacity:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure transformation:</strong> Not just roads, but complete systems—energy grids, water
          systems, digital networks</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare systems:</strong> Training doctors, building hospitals, developing treatments, preventing
          disease—not just insurance</li>
        <li><strong>Climate solutions:</strong> Building renewable energy capacity, storage systems, regenerative
          agriculture</li>
        <li><strong>Education and skills:</strong> Preparing populations for technological change and economic
          participation</li>
      </ul>

      <p><span class="highlight">These missions create real productive capacity—new industries, skilled workers, solved
          problems—not just financial transactions.</span> When nations invest in building real capabilities, growth
        follows naturally as a result, not as an abstract goal.</p>

      <h3>Smart Contract Monitoring</h3>

      <p>The principle of "national fiscal autonomy with guardrails for global stability" is enforced by code:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Smart contracts monitor each nation's balance continuously</li>
        <li>Transactions that would push a nation's debit beyond allowed threshold are prevented</li>
        <li>Warnings and fees apply as countries approach limits</li>
        <li>All issuance is transparently visible on the blockchain</li>
        <li>Assembly can adjust quotas democratically as economies evolve</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conditionality: Public Investment Serves Public Good</h2>

      <p>When nations issue Commons Units for large-scale investment, certain conditions ensure the benefits flow
        broadly rather than concentrating in private hands:</p>

      <h3>Required Conditions for Major Issuance:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reinvestment requirements:</strong> Companies receiving public investment cannot use funds primarily
          for share buybacks or executive compensation—profits must flow back into productive capacity</li>
        <li><strong>Worker protections:</strong> Public investment must include fair wages, safe conditions, and
          meaningful worker participation</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility guarantees:</strong> Essential goods developed with public funds (medicines, energy,
          housing) must remain affordable</li>
        <li><strong>Knowledge sharing:</strong> Breakthroughs from public investment should be widely licensed, not
          locked behind restrictive patents</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental standards:</strong> All investment must meet sustainability criteria</li>
        <li><strong>Equity participation:</strong> When public investment creates successful enterprises, the public
          should share in returns through equity ownership or revenue sharing</li>
      </ul>

      <p><span class="highlight">These aren't restrictions—they're the deal. If you benefit from public investment, you
          have responsibilities to the public.</span> This prevents the pattern where public money takes the risk while
        private shareholders capture all the reward.</p>

      <h2>Ongoing Monetary Policy</h2>

      <p>The overall supply of Commons Units and inflation targeting are managed collectively by the governance
        assembly.</p>

      <h3>Inflation Targets</h3>

      <p>The assembly might set a global inflation target (e.g., 2% annually) and adjust baseline currency supply growth
        accordingly. This could be implemented through:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Uniform distribution:</strong> New issuance distributed evenly to all member countries, maintaining
          equal shares</li>
        <li><strong>Development bias:</strong> Modest preference to less-developed economies with lower per-capita
          allocation</li>
        <li><strong>Economic conditions:</strong> Expansion rate adjusted based on global economic indicators</li>
        <li><strong>Democratic decision:</strong> Assembly votes on whether currency is kept scarce or moderately
          inflationary for growth</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Proactive Inflation Assessment</h3>

      <p><span class="highlight">A defining feature of Commons Currency is that inflationary impact is assessed BEFORE
          currency is created, not after.</span> Every issuance proposal undergoes rigorous economic modeling to
        evaluate its effect on price stability.</p>

      <p><strong>The assessment process includes:</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Real-time economic modeling:</strong> Continuous monitoring of productive capacity, supply
          constraints, resource availability, and aggregate demand across all member economies</li>
        <li><strong>Impact projections:</strong> Each proposed issuance (whether national, local, or global) is
          evaluated for its marginal effect on inflation</li>
        <li><strong>Resource capacity analysis:</strong> Can the real economy absorb this new purchasing power without
          bidding up prices? Are there idle resources (unemployed workers, unused factories) that can be mobilized?</li>
        <li><strong>Sector-specific modeling:</strong> Where will this currency flow? Which sectors might experience
          bottlenecks?</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent justification:</strong> All issuance decisions include public explanation of the
          inflation assessment and supporting economic data</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This predictive approach fundamentally differs from current systems where central banks primarily react to
        inflation after it appears in price indices.</p>

      <h3>Inflation Control Without Austerity</h3>

      <p>Given the principle of "inflation control without austerity," the system allows controlled expansion of money
        supply to meet global demand, without imposing draconian measures on individual countries.</p>

      <p>For example, a built-in algorithm could expand supply at 2% annually allocated to countries, unless the
        assembly votes to change it in response to economic conditions. <span class="highlight">The real-time
          transparency of the global ledger, combined with predictive inflation modeling, enables proactive management
          rather than reactive crisis
          responses.</span></p>

      <h2>Transparency & Accountability</h2>

      <p>All currency issuance is recorded on the blockchain:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Genesis allocations:</strong> Publicly visible for each country</li>
        <li><strong>Claim events:</strong> When countries join and activate their allocation</li>
        <li><strong>Proportional adjustments:</strong> Historical record of how escrowed accounts were adjusted</li>
        <li><strong>National issuance:</strong> Every CU created by a nation is traceable</li>
        <li><strong>Supply metrics:</strong> Total supply, circulating supply, escrowed supply all publicly auditable
        </li>
        <li><strong>Assembly votes:</strong> All monetary policy decisions permanently recorded</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This transparency prevents manipulation and allows citizens, economists, and regulators worldwide to verify
        that the system operates fairly.</p>

      <h2>Transition Scenarios</h2>

      <h3>Early Adopter Countries</h3>

      <p>Countries joining early might receive incentives:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Participation in initial governance rule-setting</li>
        <li>Early access to surplus recycling investment funds</li>
        <li>Ability to shape system evolution</li>
        <li>But importantly: <strong>no economic advantage</strong> in allocation size</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Late Adopter Countries</h3>

      <p>Countries joining later are protected:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Proportionally adjusted genesis allocation (as described above)</li>
        <li>Full voting rights immediately upon joining</li>
        <li>Same quota formulas applied equally</li>
        <li>No penalty for waiting to assess system performance</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Non-Participating Countries</h3>

      <p>Countries that choose not to participate:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Genesis allocation remains in escrow indefinitely</li>
        <li>Continues to be adjusted proportionally with global monetary policy</li>
        <li>Can be claimed whenever the country decides to join</li>
        <li>No time limit or expiration</li>
      </ul>
