      <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 3.2rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; line-height: 1.2;">The Charter of
        Economic Rights and Responsibilities</h1>

      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.1rem; font-style: italic; color: #666; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
        A Covenant for the Economic Order of Humanity
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.95rem; color: #999; margin-bottom: 4rem;">
        Building upon the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948),<br>
        the Second Bill of Rights (1944), and the Charter of the United Nations (1945)
      </p>

      <hr style="margin: 4rem 0; border: none; border-top: 3px solid #000;">

      <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2rem; margin: 3rem 0;">Preamble</h2>

      <p style="font-size: 1.15rem; line-height: 2; text-align: justify;">
        <strong>We, the peoples of Earth,</strong> recognizing that humanity has reached a stage of maturity requiring
        new forms of global cooperation, and understanding that economic justice is inseparable from human dignity,
        hereby establish this Charter as the foundation for a world economic order that serves all people.
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 1.15rem; line-height: 2; text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Convinced</strong> that true prosperity requires both freedom and structure—that civilization needs
        coordination without domination, and liberty without fragmentation;
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 1.15rem; line-height: 2; text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Affirming</strong> that money must serve humanity, not command it; that wealth must reflect value
        created, not debt incurred; and that economic institutions must answer to conscience, not merely calculation;
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 1.15rem; line-height: 2; text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Believing</strong> that every human being possesses inherent dignity deserving of material security,
        meaningful work, and participation in economic decisions affecting their lives;
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 1.15rem; line-height: 2; text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Determined</strong> to build economic institutions that embody consultation over competition,
        transparency over opacity, and service over extraction;
      </p>

      <p style="font-size: 1.15rem; line-height: 2; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 3rem;">
        <strong>We hereby proclaim</strong> this Charter as the moral and practical foundation for the Commons Currency
        system and the economic order it creates.
      </p>

      <hr style="margin: 4rem 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>Article I: Foundational Principles</h2>

      <h3>Section 1: The Purpose of Economic Order</h3>

      <p>The purpose of economic organization is to ensure that all people can develop their capacities, contribute to
        the common good, and live with dignity. Economic systems exist to serve human flourishing, not as ends in
        themselves.</p>

      <h3>Section 2: Unity in Diversity</h3>

      <p>Humanity is one family, diverse in culture and circumstance but united in essential rights and
        responsibilities. Economic order must honor this diversity while creating unity of purpose.</p>

      <h3>Section 3: Stewardship</h3>

      <p>The Earth's resources are a trust for all generations. Economic activity must preserve and enhance the natural
        world, recognizing that ecological health and human prosperity are inseparable.</p>

      <h3>Section 4: Consultation and Cooperation</h3>

      <p>Economic decisions shall be made through consultation, not competition. Nations and peoples shall work together
        to solve shared problems, recognizing that cooperation serves all better than conflict.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 4rem 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid #e0e0e0;">

        <li>Build creditworthiness through demonstrated reliability, not inherited wealth</li>
        <li>Privacy in personal economic affairs</li>
      </ul>

      <hr style="margin: 4rem 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>Article III: Economic Responsibilities</h2>

      <h3>Individual Responsibilities</h3>

      <p><strong>Every person shall:</strong></p>

      <ul style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 2;">
        <li>Contribute to society according to their capacity</li>
        <li>Use resources with consideration for others and future generations</li>
        <li>Fulfill financial obligations honestly and reliably</li>
        <li>Respect the economic rights of others</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Community Responsibilities</h3>

      <p><strong>Communities shall:</strong></p>

      <ul style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 2;">
        <li>Create conditions enabling all members to contribute meaningfully</li>
        <li>Care for those unable to provide for themselves</li>
        <li>Make economic decisions consultatively and transparently</li>
        <li>Balance local autonomy with global cooperation</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>National Responsibilities</h3>

      <p><strong>Nations shall:</strong></p>

      <ul style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 2;">
        <li>Ensure the economic rights of their citizens are fulfilled</li>
        <li>Participate constructively in global economic governance</li>
        <li>Accept responsibilities proportionate to their economic capacity</li>
        <li>Pursue full employment and social investment</li>
        <li>Collect fair taxation to support public goods</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Global Responsibilities</h3>

      <p><strong>The community of nations shall:</strong></p>

      <ul style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 2;">
        <li>Maintain a stable and just monetary system</li>
        <li>Prevent any nation or people from falling into desperate poverty</li>
        <li>Coordinate to address challenges transcending borders</li>
        <li>Preserve the Earth's environment and resources</li>
      </ul>

      <hr style="margin: 4rem 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>Article IV: The Monetary System</h2>

      <h3>Section 1: Purpose of Money</h3>

      <p>Money is a social technology for coordinating human activity and allocating resources. It shall be designed and
        governed to serve the common good, not to concentrate power or extract value from the productive economy.</p>

      <h3>Section 2: Money as Measure of Value</h3>

      <p>Money shall represent real value created through productive work, care for others, environmental restoration,
        cultural contribution, and all activities that serve human and ecological flourishing. It shall not be created
        primarily as debt requiring perpetual growth.</p>

      <p><strong>Value creation must be distinguished from value extraction.</strong> Economic activity that builds
        productive capacity—infrastructure, education, innovation, care—creates value. Activity that merely extracts
        returns from existing assets—financial speculation, monopoly rents, tax evasion—does not. Commons Currency
        shall flow primarily toward value creation, while taxation discourages extraction.</p>

      <h3>Section 3: Universal Currency</h3>

      <p>There shall be one global currency—the Commons Unit—available to all people and accepted universally. This
        unity of currency shall end the speculation, manipulation, and crises that arise from competitive national
        currencies.</p>

      <h3>Section 4: Democratic Issuance</h3>

      <p>Currency shall be issued at three levels:</p>

      <ul style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 2;">
        <li><strong>Local Commons Trusts</strong> shall issue currency when communities create measurable value through
          building, healing, educating, and restoring</li>
        <li><strong>National governments</strong> shall issue currency within democratic quotas for public purposes and
          full employment</li>
        <li><strong>The Global Commons Council</strong> shall ensure total supply reflects real global capacity and need
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>The real constraint is productive capacity, not money itself.</strong> Nations can issue currency to
        mobilize idle resources—unemployed workers, unused factories, unmet needs—without causing inflation. The
        question is never "can we afford it?" but rather "do we have the real resources to accomplish it?"</p>

      <h3>Section 5: Taxation Drives Demand</h3>

      <p>Tax obligations denominated in Commons Units create inherent demand for the currency. Taxation shall serve two
        purposes: creating currency demand and removing excess money to prevent inflation. Nations shall coordinate tax
        policy to prevent harmful competition and ensure fair contribution from all economic actors.</p>

      <h3>Section 6: Proactive Inflation Prevention</h3>

      <p><strong>The inflationary impact of all currency issuance shall be assessed BEFORE money is created, not
          after.</strong> Economic modeling shall continuously evaluate whether proposed issuance aligns with real
        productive capacity. If analysis indicates potential inflation, issuance shall be reduced, delayed, or balanced
        through taxation. This predictive approach prevents inflation through wisdom rather than managing it through
        austerity.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 4rem 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>Article V: Institutional Architecture</h2>

      <h3>Section 1: Layered Governance</h3>

      <p>Economic governance shall operate at nested levels—local, regional, national, and global—each with appropriate
        authority and responsibility. Higher levels coordinate; lower levels implement.</p>

      <h3>Section 2: Elected Bodies</h3>

      <p>At each level, elected councils chosen for trustworthiness and competence shall:</p>

      <ul style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 2;">
        <li>Represent their constituents' interests</li>
        <li>Make decisions through consultative deliberation</li>
        <li>Administer economic institutions transparently</li>
        <li>Be accountable through regular democratic renewal</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Section 3: Appointed Guardians</h3>

      <p>Alongside elected bodies, appointed Counsellors, Auditors, and Trustees chosen for moral standing, experience,
        and wisdom shall:</p>

      <ul style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 2;">
        <li>Advise on long-term consequences and ethical dimensions</li>
        <li>Oversee integrity and adherence to principles</li>
        <li>Represent humanity's moral conscience within economic order</li>
        <li>Ensure decisions serve the whole, not merely the powerful</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>The elected manage; the appointed guide.</strong> Neither commands alone; both serve the common good.
      </p>

      <h3>Section 4: The Global Commons Council</h3>

      <p>The supreme coordinating body shall be a Global Commons Council where:</p>

      <ul style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 2;">
        <li>Each nation has one vote, regardless of size or wealth</li>
        <li>Major decisions require supermajority consensus (two-thirds)</li>
        <li>All proceedings are transparent and publicly recorded</li>
        <li>Appointed ethical guardians advise but do not override democratic will</li>
      </ul>

      <hr style="margin: 4rem 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>Article VI: Trade and Balance</h2>

      <h3>Section 1: Symmetric Adjustment</h3>

      <p>Both surplus and deficit nations share responsibility for maintaining trade balance. Persistent imbalances
        shall be addressed through:</p>

      <ul style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 2;">
        <li>Automatic recycling of surplus into deficit nation investment</li>
        <li>Incentives for surplus countries to increase domestic consumption and imports</li>
        <li>Support for deficit countries to develop productive capacity</li>
        <li>No country shall be forced into austerity or unemployment to correct imbalances</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Section 2: Fair Exchange</h3>

      <p>Trade shall occur on terms that:</p>

      <ul style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 2;">
        <li>Allow all nations to pursue full employment</li>
        <li>Prevent exploitation of labor or environmental standards</li>
        <li>Protect nascent industries while preventing protectionism</li>
        <li>Ensure access to essential goods for all nations</li>
      </ul>

      <hr style="margin: 4rem 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>Article VII: Financial Services and Credit</h2>

      <h3>Section 1: Universal Access</h3>

      <p>Every person shall have access to basic financial services: secure savings, reliable payments, and fair credit.
        Financial exclusion based on geography, poverty, or identity is a violation of economic rights.</p>

      <h3>Section 2: Decentralized Credit</h3>

      <p>Credit shall be available based on demonstrated reliability, not inherited wealth. Through proof of personhood
        and zero-knowledge creditworthiness proofs, individuals can build financial reputation and access capital while
        maintaining privacy.</p>

      <h3>Section 3: Local Banking</h3>

      <p>Local banks, cooperatives, and community financial institutions shall be strengthened, not replaced. They serve
        the vital role of channeling capital to local needs based on local knowledge.</p>

      <h3>Section 4: Productive Credit</h3>

      <p>Credit shall primarily serve productive purposes: building, learning, healing, creating. Speculation and
        extraction shall be discouraged through appropriate taxation and regulation.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 4rem 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>Article VIII: Taxation and Revenue</h2>

      <h3>Section 1: Coordinated Standards</h3>

      <p>Nations shall establish coordinated minimum tax standards preventing harmful competition and ensuring adequate
        public revenue. This includes:</p>

      <ul style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 2;">
        <li>Minimum corporate tax rates</li>
        <li>Progressive personal income taxation</li>
        <li>Wealth and inheritance taxes preventing dynastic accumulation</li>
        <li>Financial transaction taxes deterring speculation</li>
        <li>Environmental taxes reflecting true costs</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Section 2: Tax Haven Elimination</h3>

      <p>No jurisdiction shall serve as a tax haven enabling evasion of obligations. All financial flows shall be
        transparent to relevant authorities. The race to the bottom ends.</p>

      <h3>Section 3: Progressive Fairness</h3>

      <p>Those with greater capacity shall contribute proportionally more. Economic power carries responsibility to
        society.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 4rem 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>Article IX: Transparency and Accountability</h2>

      <h3>Section 1: Public Ledger</h3>

      <p>All monetary operations, government expenditures, and institutional decisions shall be recorded on a public
        blockchain accessible to all. Corruption requires darkness; we choose light.</p>

      <h3>Section 2: Privacy Balance</h3>

      <p>While institutional operations are transparent, individual economic affairs remain private. Zero-knowledge
        proofs enable selective disclosure—proving facts without revealing details.</p>

      <h3>Section 3: Democratic Oversight</h3>

      <p>Economic institutions answer to the people. Regular public reporting, citizen participation mechanisms, and
        democratic accountability ensure power serves rather than dominates.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 4rem 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>Article X: Environmental Stewardship</h2>

      <h3>Section 1: Ecological Limits</h3>

      <p>Economic activity must respect planetary boundaries. Currency issuance and resource allocation shall account
        for environmental capacity and regeneration requirements.</p>

      <h3>Section 2: Restorative Economy</h3>

      <p>Economic value shall be recognized for activities that restore and regenerate: reforestation, soil building,
        ecosystem protection, pollution reduction. Destruction shall not be profitable.</p>

      <h3>Section 3: Future Generations</h3>

      <p>Current prosperity cannot come at the expense of future generations. Long-term thinking is embedded through
        appointed guardians and intergenerational accounting.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 4rem 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>Article XI: Implementation and Evolution</h2>

      <h3>Section 1: Gradual Transition</h3>

      <p>This Charter shall be implemented gradually over generations. National currencies may coexist during
        transition, but the goal is clear: one world, one currency, one coordinated economic order serving all.</p>

      <h3>Section 2: Learning and Adaptation</h3>

      <p>Economic institutions shall learn from experience. Regular review and adjustment processes allow evolution
        while maintaining core principles.</p>

      <h3>Section 3: Universal Participation</h3>

      <p>This Charter is open to all nations and peoples. Joining is voluntary; participation is encouraged. The
        benefits of cooperation increase with inclusion.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 4rem 0; border: none; border-top: 2px solid #e0e0e0;">

      <h2>Article XII: Supremacy of Human Dignity</h2>

      <h3>Section 1: Economic Order Serves Humanity</h3>

      <p>When conflicts arise between economic efficiency and human dignity, dignity prevails. When markets and morals
        conflict, morals guide. When profit and people clash, people matter most.</p>

      <h3>Section 2: No Person Left Behind</h3>

      <p>Economic arrangements that leave any human being in desperate poverty while others live in obscene luxury are
        unjust and shall be reformed. Extreme inequality is incompatible with human dignity and social stability.</p>

      <h3>Section 3: Solidarity</h3>

      <p>We are one human family. The suffering of any diminishes all. The flourishing of each enriches the whole.
        Economic order must reflect this fundamental truth.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 4rem 0; border: none; border-top: 3px solid #000;">

      <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2rem; margin: 4rem 0 2rem;">Closing Affirmation</h2>

      <p
        style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 2; text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 3rem; font-style: italic;">
        This Charter represents humanity's commitment to build an economic order worthy of our highest aspirations. We
        choose cooperation over competition, conscience over calculation, and service over extraction.
      </p>

      <p
        style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 2; text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto 3rem; font-style: italic;">
