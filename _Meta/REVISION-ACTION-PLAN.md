**Use research from:** `Monetary History Vignettes.md` lines 1-150

**Key elements to include:**
- Opening: Boldon Colliery, Durham, spring 1926
- Family snapshot: Edith (wife), baby Henry born February 1926, older children

- Community infrastructure: Durham County £250k meals, soup kitchens
- The breaking point: November 1926, "starved into submission"
- Return to work: 13% wage cut, nothing gained
- The devastating comparison: "family ate better under WWII rationing than under 1920s monetary orthodoxy"
- Connection explicit: "This wasn't fate or market forces—it was Churchill's April 28, 1925 decision to value the pound's prestige over workers' livelihoods"

**Structural placement:** After Churchill's blunder section, before gold sinks data

---

**Thursday-Friday Week 1: American Farmer Story (600 words)**

- Family dispersal: children to relatives, wife to town for work
- "The debt remained constant at $5,000. But in 1920, that was 2,000 bushels of wheat. By 1933, it was 10,000 bushels—more than his entire annual production"
- Modern parallel: "This is what adjustable-rate mortgages did to homeowners in 2008—the debt stayed fixed while income collapsed"

**Structural placement:** After gold sinks section, before Roosevelt's revolution

---

- Reserve ratios: "Varied wildly: Child estimated 10%, Backwell closer to 66%, no regulations"
- Scale: "Backwell held £295,994 for depositors by 1672—equivalent to 10% of all specie in England"
- The discovery: "Goldsmiths realized receipts rarely returned for redemption. They could lend the same gold multiple times. Fractional reserve banking was born—not through design but through observation"

---

**Thursday-Friday Week 3: Backwell's Morning Scene (400 words)**

- Nine others "undermined" (partially failed, slow collapse)

- Bishop Burnet's quote: "multitudes...were ruined by this dishonourable and perfidious action"
- No resolution mechanism: "No central bank to provide liquidity. No bankruptcy courts. No deposit insurance. Just ruin"

**Add:**
- Conference detail: "730 delegates, 44 nations, Mount Washington Hotel hastily reopened after closure since 1942"
- Keynes vs White: "Keynes's International Clearing Union—elegant, supranational, designed to prevent gold hoarding disasters. White's dollar-centered system—pragmatic, backed by American gold and power"
- Negotiation drama: "Keynes called it a 'vast monkey-house,' designed 'so the President can say 44 nations agreed.' White won not through superior logic but through superior power—America held 60% of world's gold"
- The compromise: "Gold-exchange standard: dollars backed by gold, other currencies backed by dollars. America became the world's banker"

**Wednesday-Thursday: Expand Triffin dilemma (+300 words)**

**Current section adequate but add:**
- Mechanism detail: "To supply world with dollars, U.S. must run deficits. But persistent deficits undermine confidence in dollar-gold convertibility. Catch-22"
- De Gaulle's challenge: "France exchanged $750M for gold 1965-1968, draining Fort Knox"

**Friday: Expand Nixon decision moment (+200 words)**

**Add emotional dimension:**
- "Camp David, August 13-15, 1971. Nixon with Connally, Burns, Shultz. The decision: close the gold window or watch reserves drain"

   - "The constraint isn't money—it's political will and whose needs matter"
