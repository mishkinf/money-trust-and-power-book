## CROSS-CHAPTER PATTERNS

### Rhythm and Sentence Variation: ✅ EXCELLENT

The book demonstrates sophisticated rhythm variation:
- Short punchy sentences (1-10 words) for emphasis
- Medium explanatory (15-25 words) for clarity
- Longer analytical (30-45 words) for complexity
- Strategic use of 45+ word sentences

**Effective patterns:**
- Contemporary → historical → analytical → contemporary
- Human story → principle → example → synthesis
- Question → exploration → answer → implications

**Minor issues:**
- Some technical sections have extended 30+ word sentence runs
- Could use more deliberate rhythm breaks in dense passages

### Engagement Mechanisms: ✅ STRONG

**What works consistently:**
1. Contemporary openings in every chapter
2. Human stories anchor abstract concepts
3. Concrete examples ("Follow the Silver," Farmer A)
4. Data visualizations break up text
5. "Why This Matters Now" boxes

**Could improve:**
1. More frequent subheadings in long sections
2. More white space in dense technical passages
3. Smoother transitions between some sections

### Word Repetition: ✅ GOOD

**Effective repetition (intentional):**
- "Institutional credibility" - key concept
- "Productive capacity" - core principle
- "Trust" - thematic anchor

**Minor excessive repetition:**
- "Gold standard" (unavoidable in Chs. 6-10)
- "Fiat money" (unavoidable in Ch. 13)
- Some phrases like "the system worked" appear close together

**Fixes:** Vary phrasing, use pronouns/synonyms more

### Pacing Consistency: ✅ APPROPRIATE VARIATION

**Fastest-paced:** Chapters 2, 3, 8 (feel rushed)
**Well-paced:** Chapters 1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12
**Densest:** Chapters 6, 9, 11, 13 (appropriate to content)

Variation is generally appropriate, but Chapters 3 and 8 should match depth of others.
