- Core inflation

### Historical Events Mentioned Without Context:
- Bretton Woods
- Nine Years' War

## RECOMMENDATIONS:

### High Priority (Critical for Understanding):
1. Define SPECIE on first use (Ch 2, line 11)
2. Define FIAT on first use (Preface, line 8)
3. Define CONVERTIBILITY on first use (Preface, line 6)
4. Define GDP on first use (Ch 3, line 70)
5. Define BILLS OF EXCHANGE clearly in Ch 2
6. Define LIQUIDITY on first use (Ch 2, line 65)

### Medium Priority (Helpful for Clarity):
1. Add brief definitions for archaic terms (corvée, aerarium, etc.)
2. Define economic jargon (endogenous, procyclical, etc.)
3. Add context for historical events (Bretton Woods, etc.)
4. Clarify accounting terms (assets/liabilities, debit/credit)

### Low Priority (Nice to Have):
1. Define foreign terms (cambium, agio, etc.)
2. Explain historical positions (Warden of Mint, etc.)
3. Add context for foreign currencies (florins, ducats, etc.)

## NEXT STEPS:

1. Create definitions for all High Priority terms
2. Add inline definitions at first use
3. Consider adding a glossary at the end
4. Ensure consistency across chapters
5. Test with beta readers unfamiliar with economics
