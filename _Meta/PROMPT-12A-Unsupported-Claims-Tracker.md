# Unsupported Claims Tracker

**Purpose:** Track factual claims in book chapters that lack corresponding documentation in Research folder.

**Verification Standard:** 
- ✅ **VERIFIED** = Claim found in Research folder with supporting details
- ⚠️ **UNSUPPORTED** = Claim not found in Research folder (may still be accurate but lacks internal documentation)
- ❌ **CONTRADICTED** = Claim contradicts Research folder content

**Note:** "Unsupported" doesn't mean incorrect - it means the claim lacks corresponding Research folder documentation and should either (a) have research added, or (b) cite external sources properly.

### ⚠️ UNSUPPORTED CLAIMS

#### 1. Chinese Jiaozi Circulation Numbers (Lines 75-76)

**Claim:** "By 1204, over **4 million notes circulated** backed by only 700,000 coins in reserves"

**Research Check:**
- Searched: `Research/` folder for "jiaozi", "4 million", "700,000"
- Found: General confirmation of jiaozi existence in 3 research files:
  - `Historical Money Systems_.md` - Confirms 960-1127 AD first government paper money
  - `Money from Ancient Times.md` - Confirms Song Dynasty jiaozi
  - `The Lost History.md` - Confirms taxation requirement for jiaozi
- **Missing:** Specific numbers (4 million notes, 700,000 coins, 1204 date)
- Status: ⚠️ Historical context verified, specific quantitative claims unsupported

**Citation in Chapter:** Source 6

**Recommendation:** 
- [ ] Verify Source 6 contains these specific numbers
- [ ] Add research file documenting jiaozi quantitative details
- [ ] Or remove/qualify specific numbers ("millions of notes circulated")

- Found: Wisselbank 1609 founding VERIFIED, but NO specific "500 coins" number
- `Comprehensive Monetary History.md` mentions "multiple-currency chaos" but no specific count

**Status:** ⚠️ Context verified, specific number unsupported

**Recommendation:**
- [ ] Verify chapter source contains "500 coins" claim
- [ ] Add research documentation for pre-1609 Amsterdam currency chaos
- [ ] Or qualify as "hundreds of different coins"

---

**Status:** ⚠️ Unsupported & potentially erroneous (ducats = gold typically)

**Recommendation:**
- [ ] Verify chapter source (Source 8) for "silver ducats"
