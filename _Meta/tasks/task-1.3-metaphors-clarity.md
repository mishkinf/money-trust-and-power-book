## Subtasks

### 1.3.1: Chapter 1 - Explain "Palatial Balance-Sheet Economies"

**Location**: Chapter 1, line 10

**Current Text**:
```
Hudson calls them *"palatial balance-sheet economies"*: they lent resources during planting season...
```

**Action**: Add one sentence explaining this in plain language before moving on.

**Example Addition**:
```
Hudson calls them *"palatial balance-sheet economies"*—centralized systems where temples and palaces functioned as both banks and accounting offices, tracking debts and credits across the entire society. They lent resources during planting season...
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Plain-language explanation added
- [ ] Doesn't disrupt flow
- [ ] Makes concept accessible to general readers

---

### 1.3.2: Chapter 3 - Expand "The Circular Trap" Section Title

**Location**: Chapter 3, line 73 (section title)

**Current Text**:
```
### The circular trap
```

**Action**: Make the section title more explicit about the mechanism.

**Example Revision**:
```
### The circular trap: why war required credit, credit required trust, and trust required institutions
```

**Alternative** (if too long for section title): Add a brief opening sentence to the section explaining the trap.

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Section title expanded OR opening sentence added
- [ ] Mechanism made explicit
- [ ] Maintains readability

---

### 1.3.3: Chapter 5 - Improve "Paradox of Paper" Metaphor

**Location**: Chapter 5, lines 101-109 (section "The paradox of paper")

**Current Text**: The section explains the concept but could use a more vivid metaphor.

**Action**: Add a concrete metaphor to make the concept memorable.

**Example Addition** (after line 107, before "This was the paradox..."):
```
The system was like a bridge held up by collective belief. As long as everyone walked across confidently, the structure held firm. But if everyone stopped simultaneously to test its strength—to demand gold and verify the Bank's reserves—the bridge would collapse under the weight of scrutiny. The paradox was that the system worked precisely because most people did not test it.
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Vivid metaphor added
- [ ] Makes abstract concept concrete
- [ ] Maintains narrative voice
- [ ] Doesn't feel forced

### 1.3.4: Chapter 7 - Retitle "The Lesson of the Breaking"

**Location**: Chapter 7, line 182 (section title)

**Current Text**:
```
### The lesson of the breaking
```

**Issue**: This title is somewhat generic and doesn't capture the transformative nature of the gold standard's collapse.

**Action**: Consider a more evocative title.

**Options**:
- "The liberation from gold"
- "The unshackling"
- "Freedom and fragility"
- "The end of the fiction"

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] New title chosen
- [ ] More evocative than current title
- [ ] Captures the transformative nature of the change
- [ ] Maintains consistency with manuscript voice

### 1.3.5: Chapter 8 - Retitle "The Lesson of History"

**Location**: Chapter 8, line 109 (section title)

**Current Text**:
```
### The lesson of history
```

**Issue**: This title duplicates a similar title in the Epilogue and is somewhat generic.

**Action**: Choose a more specific title.

**Options**:
- "The continuity beneath the change"
- "Five millennia, one principle"
- "What history teaches"
- "The enduring truth"

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] New title chosen
- [ ] Different from Epilogue section
- [ ] More specific than "lesson of history"
- [ ] Maintains voice consistency
