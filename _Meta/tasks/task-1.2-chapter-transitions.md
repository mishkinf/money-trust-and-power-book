## Subtasks

### 1.2.1: Chapter 3 Ending Transition

**Location**: Chapter 3, end (after line 94, before Sources section)

**Current ending**: Chapter ends with synthesis about the fiscal-military state and Bank of England.

**Action**: Add a brief forward-looking paragraph.

**Example Text**:

```markdown
The machinery of that state—the institution that would turn parliamentary promises into liquid credit—had yet to be invented. That innovation would come in 1694, when a group of London merchants proposed a radical solution: a bank that would lend to the government by creating money. The Bank of England would complete the revolution that began in 1688, transforming not just England's finances but the nature of money itself.
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Transition paragraph added
- [ ] Sets up Chapter 4
- [ ] Maintains narrative momentum
- [ ] Doesn't feel repetitive with existing ending

---

### 1.2.2: Chapter 4 Ending Transition

**Location**: Chapter 4, end (after line 143, before Sources section)

**Current ending**: Ends with synthesis about money as relationship and legal architecture.

**Action**: Add forward-looking paragraph about money creation mechanics.

**Example Text**:

```markdown
But how, exactly, did this system work in practice? How did the Bank create money by lending? Why did taxation make those notes valuable domestically while parliamentary credibility satisfied foreign lenders? The mechanics of this revolutionary system—the alchemy that turned promises into purchasing power—would define modern finance and reveal truths about money that had been obscured for millennia.
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Transition paragraph added
- [ ] Sets up Chapter 5's focus on mechanics
- [ ] Creates curiosity about the "how"
- [ ] Flows naturally from Chapter 4's ending

---

### 1.2.3: Chapter 5 Ending Transition

**Location**: Chapter 5, end (after line 121, before Sources section)

**Current ending**: Ends with synthesis about England's financial advantage.

**Action**: Add forward-looking paragraph about the 1797 crisis.

**Example Text**:

```markdown
But this domestic alchemy—taxation creating demand for paper money, the Bank creating money by lending—would face its greatest test when war forced Britain to choose between gold and survival. In 1797, that choice would arrive. French troops would land in Wales, panic would grip London, and the Bank's gold reserves would drain away. The government would face a decision that seemed impossible: suspend gold convertibility and risk destroying the currency, or maintain convertibility and watch the Bank fail. What happened next would prove that the system's foundation was not gold but trust—and that trust, properly earned, could survive even the loss of metal backing.
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Transition paragraph added
- [ ] Creates dramatic tension for Chapter 7
- [ ] Previews the Bank Restriction Act
- [ ] Maintains narrative voice

---

### 1.2.4: Chapter 6 Ending Transition

**Location**: Chapter 6, end (after line 135, before Sources section)

**Current ending**: Ends with synthesis about Newton's accident and trust in institutions.

**Action**: Add forward-looking paragraph about gold standard's coming stresses.

**Example Text**:

```markdown
For two centuries, the gold standard would define monetary orthodoxy. It would be praised as the foundation of prosperity, damned as the cause of depression, and defended with religious fervor by those who could not imagine an alternative. But the system Newton accidentally created contained fatal contradictions. It would survive wars and financial panics, only to collapse catastrophically when those contradictions became unbearable. The breaking would begin in 1797, accelerate in 1914, and conclude in 1971—revealing at last that gold had never been necessary, that money had always been a human institution, and that trust could be built without metal if the institutions were strong enough.
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Transition paragraph added
- [ ] Previews Chapter 7's scope (1797-1971)
- [ ] Creates sense of inevitability about gold standard's collapse
- [ ] Maintains thematic consistency

---

### 1.2.5: Chapter 7 Ending Transition

**Location**: Chapter 7, end (after line 189, before Sources section)

**Current ending**: Ends with synthesis about the breaking being complete and fiat era beginning.

**Action**: Add forward-looking paragraph about the modern fiat system.

**Example Text**:

```markdown
The age of pure fiat had begun, but its architecture was still being built. How would central banks manage money creation without gold's constraint? How would governments maintain fiscal discipline without automatic limits? How would international coordination work without fixed exchange rates? These questions would shape the next half-century, as the world learned to operate a monetary system based entirely on institutional credibility. The answers would emerge through crisis and experimentation, revealing both the power and the fragility of money sustained by trust alone.
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Transition paragraph added
- [ ] Sets up Chapter 8's focus on modern system
- [ ] Poses questions that Chapter 8 will address
- [ ] Maintains forward momentum

---

## Implementation Notes

- **Timing**: These transitions should feel like natural conclusions that point forward, not artificial "coming next" announcements
- **Voice**: Maintain the manuscript's narrative voice—authoritative but not pedantic
- **Length**: Keep transitions brief (3-5 sentences)—they should create momentum, not slow it down
- **Integration**: Ensure transitions flow naturally from each chapter's existing ending
