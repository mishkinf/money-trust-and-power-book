# Consistency Audit: Chapter 13

**Status:** Complete ✓

**Voice Issues:**
- Consistently third person analytical and narrative
- Opens with COVID stimulus debate (modern validation)
- Strong personal stories: Maureen McKenzie, Barbara Kantor, Victor Klemperer, Kono, Dean Hagedorn

- No jarring voice shifts

**Passive Voice:**
- Reduced 2 instances:
  - "constraint was real resources" → "Real resources constrained the economy"
  - "The lesson: **Build" → "The lesson for policymakers: **Build"
- Note: One attempted edit for Fed balance sheet caption could not be applied due to text not matching exactly

**Long Sentences:**
- No problematic 70+ word sentences
- Complex economic concepts clearly explained
- 2008 crisis mechanics well-structured
- Productive capacity principle effectively presented

**Jargon/Definitions:**
- All technical terms properly defined:
  - ✓ Quantitative easing (line 37, explained)

**Quantitative Evidence (2008 Crisis):**

**COVID Response:**
- $5 trillion stimulus (25% of GDP)
- Fed balance sheet grew 71% in 3 months
- Inflation remained subdued through 2020
- 2021-2022 inflation from supply constraints, not monetary excess

- Growth volatility under gold 2x higher than fiat

**Cryptocurrency Analysis:**
- Bitcoin's 21 million cap mimics gold scarcity
- Terra/Luna collapse: $40 billion (May 2022)
- Stablecoins depend on dollar system (Tether $113B Treasuries)
- Fixed supply = gold standard's fatal flaw

**Japan's Evidence:**
- Debt exceeds 260% of GDP
- Bank of Japan holds 50%+ of government bonds
- Deflation averaged -0.3% (1995-2013) despite money creation
- Problem was deflation, not inflation
- Validates productive capacity constraint

**Modern Connections:**
- COVID stimulus validation of MMT
- QE distributional consequences (asset owners vs workers)
- Climate/healthcare/infrastructure: constraint is resources, not money
- China's dollar trap (covered in Chapter 11)
