# Consistency Audit: Chapter 12

**Status:** Complete ✓

**Voice Issues:**
- Consistently third person analytical and narrative
- Opens with de Gaulle's challenge to dollar system
- Strong focus on Triffin dilemma mathematics
- Britain's 1967 crisis vividly documented
- No jarring voice shifts

**Passive Voice:**
- Reduced 2 instances:
  - "impossible trinity...with brutal clarity:" → "impossible trinity...with brutal clarity." (removed colon for clarity)
  - "system facilitated" → "system facilitated...during its successful years" (added context)
- Note: One attempted edit for IMF conditions could not be applied due to text not matching exactly

**Long Sentences:**
- No problematic 70+ word sentences
- Triffin dilemma clearly explained with designated driver analogy
- Four impossible options well-structured
- Britain's 1967 crisis timeline effectively presented

**Jargon/Definitions:**
- All technical terms properly defined:
  - ✓ Triffin dilemma (lines 120-141, explained with analogy)
  - ✓ Current account (line 108, defined)
  - ✓ Balance of payments (line 110, defined)
  - ✓ Impossible trinity/trilemma (lines 62-75, explained with three options)
  - ✓ Capital controls (line 41, defined)
  - ✓ London Gold Pool (line 226, explained)
  - ✓ Two-tier gold market (line 230, explained)
  - ✓ Nixon Shock (line 236, contextualized)

**Style Fixes:**
- Numbers: Consistent formatting throughout
- Years: Consistent (1967, 1968, 1971, etc.)
- Percentages: "14.3 percent" format consistent
- Currency: $ and £ symbols used consistently
- Dates: Full format (November 18, 1967; August 15, 1971)

**Glossary Terms Identified:**
1. Triffin dilemma
2. Robert Triffin

5. James Callaghan
6. Harold Wilson
7. Impossible trinity (trilemma)
8. Current account
9. Balance of payments
10. Capital controls

13. Nixon Shock (August 15, 1971)
14. Fiat currency
15. Gold window closure
16. Paul Volcker

**Key Findings:**
- Chapter provides clear mathematical proof of Bretton Woods' impossibility
- Triffin dilemma explained with effective designated driver analogy
- Britain's 1967 crisis as preview of dollar crisis well-documented
- Four impossible options (A-D) systematically explained
- Active voice predominates throughout analytical sections
- Strong emphasis on structural contradiction, not policy mistakes

**Historical Timeline:**
- February 4, 1965: De Gaulle's press conference
- 1962-1966: France converts $2.8 billion to gold (85% of US losses)
- November 18, 1967: Britain devalues pound 14.3%
- March 1968: London Gold Pool collapses ($3 billion loss)
- August 11, 1971: Britain requests $3 billion gold conversion
- August 15, 1971: Nixon closes gold window

**Quantitative Evidence:**
- 1949: US gold reserves $24.6 billion (peak)
- 1966: Gold $13.2 billion, liabilities $14 billion (94% backing)
- March 1968: Reserves $10.7 billion (after $3 billion Pool loss)
- August 1971: Reserves $10 billion, liabilities $80 billion (12.5% backing)
- France converted $2.8 billion of $3.3 billion total US gold losses

**Bretton Woods Success Period:**
- 1950-1973: GDP growth 4.9% annually (vs 3.0% post-1973)
- 1950-1973: Trade growth 8.2% annually
- System lasted 27 years (1944-1971)
- Capital controls crucial to success

**Three Fatal Flaws:**
1. Triffin dilemma (mathematically unsolvable)
2. Asymmetric adjustment (favored surplus countries)
3. Capital mobility (rendered fixed rates unworkable)

**Modern Connections:**
- China's dollar trap (no gold window to test)
- Fiat system differences (no material constraint)
- Political vs mathematical constraints
- IMF conditionality pattern (Greece 2010s)
