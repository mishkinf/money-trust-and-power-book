# Glossary Gap Analysis

## Summary
The existing glossary (`Content/_Supplementary/03-Glossary.md`) is **comprehensive and well-structured**. Most major terms from the consistency audit are already covered with good historical context and cross-references.

## Already Well-Covered
✅ All major historical terms (Bancor, Bank Restriction Act, Bretton Woods, Tally Sticks, Temple Ledgers, etc.)
✅ Key economic concepts (Chartalism, MMT, Fiat Money, Gold Standard, Triffin Dilemma, QE, etc.)
✅ Institutional terms (Central Bank, Lender of Last Resort, Parliamentary Sovereignty, etc.)
✅ Technical mechanisms (Deposit Creation, Fractional Reserve Banking, Open Market Operations, etc.)

**General Strike of 1926**

## Recommendation

**Option 1: Minimal additions** (3-5 entries)
- Impossible Trinity
- Nixon Shock  
- London Gold Pool
- Output Gap
- CBDCs

These fill the most significant conceptual gaps for readers wanting quick reference.

**Option 2: Comprehensive additions** (all high + medium priority)
Add 10-12 terms to ensure glossary covers all major concepts from Chapters 10-13 and Epilogue.

**Option 3: Leave as-is**
Current glossary is already excellent. All missing terms are well-explained in their chapter contexts. Readers can find definitions through index or chapter reading.

## Current Glossary Strengths

1. **Historical depth**: Temple ledgers through MMT chronologically covered
2. **Cross-references**: Terms reference related concepts (e.g., Chartalism → MMT)
3. **Context**: Definitions include historical examples and significance
4. **Balance**: Equal coverage of ancient, medieval, modern periods
5. **Accessibility**: Technical precision without jargon overload

The existing glossary serves readers well. Any additions should match this quality standard.
