# Consistency Audit: Preface

**Status:** Complete ✓

**Voice Issues:**
- Predominantly third person with occasional first-person plural ("we") when discussing common beliefs
- Voice is appropriately consistent for a preface - uses "This book" to establish scope
- No problematic shifts identified

**Passive Voice:**
- Fixed 4 instances of unnecessary passive constructions:
  - "The suspension was supposed to last" → "Officials expected the suspension to last"
  - "it had become nearly unthinkable" → "respectable economics found this truth nearly unthinkable"
  - "gets presented as economic necessity" → "elites present it as economic necessity"

**Long Sentences:**
- Broke up 1 sentence of 80+ words about asset price inflation
- Split into two sentences with clearer structure
- Added definition of quantitative easing in the process

**Jargon/Definitions:**
- Terms properly defined on first use:
  - ✓ Gold convertibility (line 6)
  - ✓ Gold window (line 8)
  - ✓ Fiat (line 8)
  - ✓ Tally sticks (line 24 - dates provided)
  - ✓ Quantitative easing (NOW defined in line 40)
  - ✓ Fiscal capacity (line 64 - parenthetical definition)

**Style Fixes:**
- Numbers: Consistent (spelled out "five millennia," "twenty-four years," digits for years)
- Dates: Consistent format (Year, e.g., "1797," "1971")
- Capitalization: Proper nouns appropriately capitalized
- Em-dashes: Used correctly for parenthetical definitions

1. Gold convertibility
2. Gold window
3. Fiat money
