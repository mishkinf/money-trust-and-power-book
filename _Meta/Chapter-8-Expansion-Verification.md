**8. Attwood's Death Age**
- **What I wrote:** "By the time Attwood died in 1856 at age 73"

## CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING ATTENTION

### Issue 1: Invented Narrative Details

The expansion includes vivid narrative scenes that are **invented** rather than sourced:
- The specific metalworker (15 years of service, children hungry)
- Tools carried to rallies (hammers, tongs, files)
- Ward committees
- Evening meetings in workshops/taverns

**Decision needed:** 
- Should these be removed as unsourced?
- Should they be marked as "reasonable historical inference"?
- Should they remain as narrative dramatization within bounds of known facts?

### Issue 2: Dates Need Verification

- May 7, 1832 rally (vs. parliamentary address)
- July 12, 1839 petition presentation
- "Autumn of 1821" for the metalworker scene

**Action needed:** Cross-reference with parliamentary records or find primary sources

### Issue 3: Birmingham Political Union Details

The research confirms:
- ✅ Attwood founded Birmingham Political Union
- ✅ It was powerful and influential
- ✅ Rallies of 40,000 workers occurred
- ❌ Specific organizing details (ward committees, pamphlets, evening meetings) NOT verified

**Gap:** The *how* of organizing is inferred, not documented

### Issue 4: Wealth Transfer Calculations

The £160 million figure and 20% deflation → 25% real return calculations were in the original chapter but need source verification.

**Action needed:** Find economic history sources documenting this calculation or verify the arithmetic independently

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Option A: Conservative Approach (High Academic Rigor)
1. Remove all invented narrative details (15-year metalworker, tools, etc.)
2. Mark uncertain dates with "circa" or remove them
3. Qualify organizing details with "likely" or "presumably"
4. Add footnote: "While specific organizational details are not documented, the scale of mobilization (40,000 at rallies, 1.28M signatures) required systematic coordination"

**Result:** Academically bulletproof but less vivid

### Option B: Narrative Approach (Historical Fiction Standard)
1. Keep narrative details as "reasonable historical inference"
2. Add author's note explaining dramatization within known parameters
3. Ensure no factual claims that contradict evidence
4. Frame as "bringing history to life while staying true to documented facts"

**Result:** More engaging but requires transparency about methods

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)
1. **Keep verified facts exactly as sourced**
2. **Mark uncertain but plausible details** with language like:
   - "Contemporary records document 40,000-person rallies, suggesting meticulous organization through networks that likely included..."
   - "While specific organizing methods aren't documented, the scale of mobilization required..."
3. **Remove purely invented details** that add color but no substance:
   - Remove: "15 years" specificity, exact tool types
   - Keep: General premise of worker suffering (supported), rally scale (verified), petition effort (verified)
4. **Add research footnote** explaining: "Specific organizational details reconstructed from scale of documented achievements and standard political organizing practices of the period"

**Result:** Honest about evidence while maintaining narrative power

## NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ Search for Birmingham Political Union primary sources
2. ✅ Verify petition presentation dates
3. ✅ Check economic history sources for £160M calculation
4. ✅ Decide on approach (Conservative/Narrative/Hybrid)
5. ✅ Revise Chapter 8 accordingly with proper citations
6. ✅ Add footnotes explaining inference vs. documentation

**Time estimate:** 2-4 hours to verify dates, find sources, and revise with appropriate qualifications
