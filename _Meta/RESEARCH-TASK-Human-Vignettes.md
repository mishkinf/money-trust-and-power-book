# RESEARCH TASK: Find Real People for Human Vignettes

## Objective
Identify real, documented historical individuals whose stories can illustrate key monetary concepts in the manuscript. Each person must have verifiable historical records (not composite or fictional characters).

## Success Criteria
For each person identified, provide:
1. **Full name and dates** (birth/death or active period)
2. **Primary source documentation** (letters, court records, tablets, oral histories, etc.)
3. **Specific incident or transaction** that illustrates the monetary concept
4. **Archival location** or published source where records can be accessed
5. **Key details** (amounts, dates, outcomes) that make the story concrete

## Required Vignettes

### VIGNETTE 1: Mesopotamian Farmer or Merchant (Chapter 1)
**Time Period:** 2000-1500 BCE (Old Babylonian period preferred)
**Location:** Mesopotamia (Ur, Nippur, Babylon, or other documented city)
**Concept to Illustrate:** Temple/palace credit system, clay tablet debt records, debt enforcement or jubilee

**What I Need:**
- A real person whose debt is recorded on surviving clay tablets
- Details of the debt: amount (in gur, shekels, or other units), what it was for, when recorded
- What happened: was it repaid? Forgiven in a jubilee? Did they enter debt servitude?
- The tablet's museum accession number or publication reference

**Possible Sources:**
- Yale Babylonian Collection
- British Museum cuneiform tablet collections
- Published translations of Old Babylonian economic texts
- Michael Hudson's research on debt jubilees (he cites specific tablets)
- Assyriologist publications on temple archives

**Example of what would work:**
"Tablet YBC 4151 records that Lu-Ninurta, a farmer near Nippur, borrowed 3 gur of barley from the temple in Year 7 of King Rim-Sin. The tablet shows he repaid 2.5 gur at harvest, with the remaining debt carried forward..."

### VIGNETTE 2: Medieval/Renaissance Merchant (Chapter 2)
**Time Period:** 1350-1450 CE
**Location:** Italy (Florence, Venice, Genoa, Prato) or Flanders (Bruges, Antwerp)
**Concept to Illustrate:** Bills of exchange, merchant credit networks, dependence on sovereign currency

**What I Need:**
- A real merchant with surviving correspondence or account books
- A specific bill of exchange transaction with details: amount, cities involved, exchange rate, parties
- Evidence of how the transaction settled (or didn't)
- The merchant's understanding of the system

**Best Candidate: Francesco di Marco Datini (1335-1410)**
- Datini Archive in Prato has 150,000+ letters and 500+ account books
- Well-documented transactions across Europe
- I need: ONE specific bill of exchange from his records with full details
  - Date, amount, cities, counterparties, exchange rate
  - Ideally from Iris Origo's "The Merchant of Prato" or Datini Archive publications

**Alternative Candidates:**
- Medici Bank records (1397-1494) - well documented
- Venetian merchant correspondence (Archivio di Stato di Venezia)
- Any merchant with published letter collections showing bill of exchange use

**Example of what would work:**
"On March 12, 1395, Datini wrote to his Barcelona agent instructing payment of 400 Flemish pounds to Tommaso di Ser Giovanni in Bruges for wool purchase. Letter 1089, Datini Archive. The exchange rate was..."

### VIGNETTE 3: Bank of England Clerk During Crisis (Chapter 6)
**Time Period:** 1825, 1847, or 1866 (major banking panics)
**Location:** Bank of England, Threadneedle Street, London
**Concept to Illustrate:** Gold reserve management, human judgment behind "automatic" gold standard

**What I Need:**
- A named Bank of England official (clerk, director, or governor)
- Their role during a specific crisis moment
- Specific details: gold reserve levels, dates, decisions made, outcomes
- Contemporary accounts (diaries, letters, Bank records, newspaper reports)

**Possible Sources:**
- Bank of England Archives (they have crisis management records)
- Parliamentary inquiries into banking crises (1825, 1847, 1866)
- Biographies of Bank governors (Jeremiah Harman, James Pattison, etc.)
- Contemporary newspapers (The Times, Morning Chronicle)
- Bank of England Museum collections

**Example of what would work:**
"John Whitmore, senior clerk in the Bullion Office, recorded in his diary on December 14, 1825 that gold reserves fell to £1.27 million—the lowest since 1797. His notes describe the panic outside on Threadneedle Street..."

**Alternative:** If no clerk is documented, a Bank director or governor would work (but must be specific incident, not general career)

### VIGNETTE 4: American Family During Nixon Shock (Chapter 10)
**Time Period:** August 15, 1971
**Location:** United States (any city, but middle America preferred over NYC/DC)
**Concept to Illustrate:** Public reaction to end of gold standard, gap between predicted disaster and actual outcome

**What I Need:**
- Real family or individual who watched Nixon's announcement
- Contemporary documentation: diary entry, letter, oral history, newspaper interview
- Their reaction and what actually happened to them economically
- Follow-up: how did it affect them in following months/years?

**Possible Sources:**
- Oral history collections (Library of Congress, university archives)
- Contemporary newspaper "man on the street" interviews from August 16-20, 1971
- Letters to the editor from August-September 1971
- Economic history oral history projects
- Local historical societies (might have diaries/letters from 1971)

**Example of what would work:**
"Robert Morrison of Dayton, Ohio wrote in his diary on August 15, 1971: 'Nixon closed the gold window tonight. Pat asked what it means. I don't know. Should we take money out of the bank?' [Diary held by Dayton Historical Society]. Six months later he noted: 'Nothing happened. Still have my job at NCR...'"

### VIGNETTE 5 (OPTIONAL): Bank of England Clerk During Bank Restriction (Chapter 7)
**Time Period:** 1797-1821 (Bank Restriction period)
**Location:** Bank of England, London
**Concept to Illustrate:** Paper money functioning without gold backing

**What I Need:**
- Similar to Vignette 3, but during Bank Restriction period
- Someone who witnessed the transition to inconvertible notes
- Their observations on whether the system worked
- Contemporary documentation

**Possible Sources:**
- Same as Vignette 3
- Parliamentary debates on Bank Restriction Act
- Contemporary pamphlets and letters

## Research Methodology

For each vignette:

1. **Start with secondary sources** to identify candidates
   - Biographies, economic histories, archival guides
   - Look for historians who cite specific primary sources

2. **Locate primary sources**
   - Archives, published document collections, museum catalogs
   - Get specific: tablet numbers, letter dates, diary entries

3. **Extract concrete details**
   - Names, dates, amounts, locations
   - Dialogue or direct quotes if available
   - Outcomes and consequences

4. **Verify authenticity**
   - Cross-reference with other sources
   - Confirm archival locations
   - Check that details are historically accurate

5. **Provide citation trail**
   - How to access the source
   - Published translations or transcriptions
   - Museum/archive contact information if needed

## Output Format

For each person found, provide:

```
### [Person Name]
**Dates:** [birth-death or active period]
**Location:** [city, region]
**Role:** [occupation/position]
**Concept Illustrated:** [what monetary principle their story shows]

**The Story:**
[2-3 paragraphs summarizing the incident with specific details]

**Primary Sources:**
- [Source 1: archive, collection, tablet number, etc.]
- [Source 2: published work, page numbers]
- [Source 3: contemporary account]

**Key Details for Vignette:**
- Date: [specific date or period]
- Amount: [if monetary transaction]
- Outcome: [what happened]
- Quote: [any direct quote from primary source]

**Accessibility:**
[How to access the source - online, archive visit required, published book, etc.]

**Historical Accuracy Notes:**
[Any caveats, uncertainties, or context needed]
```

## Priority Order

1. **Mesopotamian farmer/merchant** (hardest to find, start here)
2. **Francesco Datini transaction** (should be easiest - archive is well-published)
3. **Bank of England crisis clerk** (moderate difficulty)
4. **Nixon Shock family** (moderate difficulty - oral histories exist)

## Timeline

This research is needed for manuscript revision. Ideal completion: within 1-2 weeks.

## Questions to Consider

- Are there published collections of primary sources I should check first?
- Which archives have online catalogs or digitized collections?
- Are there economic history dissertations that cite specific cases?
- Do museums (British Museum, Yale Babylonian Collection) have searchable databases?

## Success Looks Like

Finding even ONE well-documented person per vignette would be sufficient. The goal is authenticity and specificity, not comprehensiveness. A single clay tablet with a farmer's name is better than a dozen generic references to "Mesopotamian debt systems."

---

**Note:** If a specific person cannot be found for ancient Mesopotamia, an alternative would be to frame it as: "Tablet YBC 4151 records the case of Lu-Ninurta..." without claiming to tell his full story—just reporting what the tablet says. This maintains authenticity while acknowledging the limits of the historical record.
