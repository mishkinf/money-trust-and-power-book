## CONFIDENCE: HIGH

**Chapter 2 demonstrates:**

- **Strong Research folder integration** (83% verification rate)
- **Clear pedagogical narrative** (medieval → modern)

## RECOMMENDATIONS

2. ⚠️ **Resolve 1819 vs 1820** closure date discrepancy

**Optional:**
3. Add research file with Amsterdam pre-1609 numismatic chaos details
4. Add research file with Wisselbank quantitative history (deposits, accounts)

**No critical errors - Chapter 2 is excellent with minor gaps in quantitative documentation**

**NEXT:** Continue rigorous verification for Chapter 3
