## MINOR ISSUES

### 1. Dating Convention - Minor

**Line 55: "ducats" description**
- Text says "silver ducats—Venetian gold coins"
- **INCONSISTENCY**: Ducats were gold coins, not silver
- Should say "gold ducats" or remove "silver"
- **Action**: Minor correction recommended

### 2. Spanish Bankruptcy Dates

**Line 108: Seven bankruptcies listed**
- 1557, 1560, 1575, 1596, 1607, 1627, 1647
- Source 20h (Drelichman & Voth 2011) covers 1566-1600
- **Status**: Partially verified, later dates need confirmation
- **Recommendation**: [VERIFY later dates from Source 8 (Ehrenberg) or add note]

---

## SPECIAL STRENGTHS

### Institutional Analysis

The chapter demonstrates sophisticated understanding of:
- **Domestic vs international credit distinction** (fundamental insight)
- **Information asymmetries** in tally stick circulation (Lines 116-118)
- **Gold as settlement medium** requiring no institutional trust (Line 122)
- **Constitutional solutions** to credibility problems (Lines 136-146)

### Modern Parallels

Exceptional integration of:
- Greece/eurozone crisis → Edward III problem
- Turkey/Argentina → Foreign currency debt
- Japan vs Greece debt levels → Monetary sovereignty
- 2008 Fed intervention → Medieval sovereign backing

---

## FACTUAL ACCURACY: EXCELLENT

No errors found in:
- Historical chronology
- Institutional descriptions  
- Economic mechanisms
- Causal relationships
- Modern parallels

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

**Required:**
1. Clarify "silver ducats—Venetian gold coins" inconsistency (Line 55)

**Optional:**
2. Add [VERIFY] for Spanish bankruptcy dates post-1600 if not in cited sources
3. Consider adding specific source for Greece €330 billion figure

**No critical errors - corrections are minor clarifications**
