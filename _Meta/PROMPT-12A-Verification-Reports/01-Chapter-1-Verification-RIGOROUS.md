## RECOMMENDATIONS

**Required:**
1. ⚠️ **Verify jiaozi numbers** (4 million, 700,000) in Source 6 or remove/qualify
2. ⚠️ **Add Lydia research** or verify Source 7 contains claim

**Optional:**
3. Consider adding research file for jiaozi with quantitative details
4. Consider adding research file for early coinage (Lydia, etc.)

**No critical errors - 2 unsupported quantitative claims need verification**

## CONFIDENCE: HIGH

**Chapter 1 demonstrates:**
- Exceptional use of primary sources (cuneiform tablets, colonial legislation)
- Strong Research folder integration (87% verification rate)
- Scholarly integrity in presenting metallist challenge
- Only 2 unsupported quantitative claims out of 15+ major claims

**The unsupported claims are likely accurate but lack Research folder documentation. This is the standard we're now applying: every claim should trace to either Research folder OR be properly cited to external sources.**
