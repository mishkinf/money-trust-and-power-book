# START HERE: QUICK IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

**Read this first. Then dive into the detailed plans.**

---

## THE SITUATION IN 30 SECONDS

You have a **strong manuscript** (52k words) that's **80% complete**. The argument is original, voice is excellent, structure works.

**BUT:** Two chapters are severely underdeveloped where they should be emotional peaks:
- **Chapter 4** (1,865 words): Private money catastrophe - told, not shown
- **Chapter 9** (2,675 words): Gold standard human cost - data, not stories

**THE FIX:** Add +20,000 words over 16 weeks, focusing first on human stories.

**THE GOOD NEWS:** You've already done the research. Files are ready. Just deploy them.

## MINDSET FOR SUCCESS

### Week 1 is Critical
**Why:** If you complete Harry Todd's story compellingly, you'll have momentum. If you don't start, inertia wins.

**Action:** Monday morning, open `Monetary History Vignettes.md` and read the Harry Todd section. Then start writing. Don't edit yet—just draft.

### Human Stories Come First
**Why:** These are what acquiring editors will look for. Data can come from research, but emotional engagement requires human stories.

**Action:** Weeks 1-4 focus entirely on human vignettes. Everything else builds on this foundation.

### You've Already Done the Hard Part
**Why:** The research is complete. The argument is sound. The voice works. You're not creating—you're deploying.

**Action:** Trust the research. Use the documented details. You don't need to invent—just translate research into narrative.

---

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### 1. Don't Start by Polishing Existing Chapters
**Why:** You need +20k words. Polish later. Draft new content first.

### 2. Don't Skip the Human Stories
**Why:** They're the hardest to write but most critical for acquisition. Do them first while energy is high.

### 3. Don't Try to Perfect Each Section Before Moving On
**Why:** You'll get stuck. Draft through, then polish in Weeks 13-16.

### 4. Don't Add Random Content to Hit Word Count
**Why:** Every addition must serve the argument. Quality over quantity.

### 5. Don't Ignore the Detailed Plans
**Why:** They're based on senior editor evaluation. They know what acquisition requires.
