## Completed Vignettes

### ✅ VIGNETTE 4: Thomas Attwood (Chapter 8)
**Status:** COMPLETE (implemented during Part III restructure)

**Location:** Opening of Chapter 8 (`03-Part-III-Gold-Standard/08-Chapter-8/01-main.md`)

**What it shows:**
- Birmingham manufacturer who witnessed 1821 deflation
- Understood monetary contraction caused worker suffering
- Gathered 1.28 million signatures demanding reform
- Dismissed as "crank," forgotten by 1856
- Was right—his ideas were "embryonic Keynesian economics"

**Why it works:**
- Real historical figure (Thomas Attwood, 1783-1856)
- Documented political activity (Birmingham Political Union, Chartist petition)
- Makes intellectual suppression personal and tragic
- Transforms Chapter 8 from academic article into narrative about power

## Quality Standards (Established by Existing Vignettes)

Based on Edward Backwell, Hugh Reynolds, and Maureen McKenzie vignettes:

**All vignettes must:**
1. ✅ Use REAL documented people (no composites or fictional characters)
2. ✅ Cite PRIMARY sources (archives, letters, tablets, oral histories)
3. ✅ Include SPECIFIC details (dates, amounts, locations, outcomes)
4. ✅ Illuminate a KEY concept (not just decorative)
5. ✅ Create EMOTIONAL engagement (readers should care)
6. ✅ Integrate SMOOTHLY (not feel like digression)

**Length guidelines:**
- Minor vignettes: 400-600 words (Mesopotamian farmer, BoE clerk, Nixon family)
- Major vignettes: 500-700 words (Medieval merchant)
- Character development: 1,000-1,200 words (Thomas Attwood - already complete)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Complete research** using `_Meta/RESEARCH-TASK-Human-Vignettes.md` as guide
2. **Find real documented people** for each remaining vignette
3. **Write vignettes** using actual historical details
4. **Integrate smoothly** into manuscript
5. **Verify citations** and source accessibility

## Success Criteria

After completing all vignettes, readers should:
- ✅ Remember specific people, not just concepts
- ✅ Feel the human stakes of monetary policy
- ✅ Connect emotionally to the historical narrative
- ✅ Understand abstract concepts through concrete examples
- ✅ Want to tell others about these stories

The manuscript should feel like:
- ✅ Narrative nonfiction (not academic history)
- ✅ A story about people (not just ideas)
- ✅ Emotionally engaging (not just intellectually stimulating)
- ✅ Memorable (not just informative)
