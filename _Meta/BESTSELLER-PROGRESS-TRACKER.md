- ✅ Great Fire 1666 (324 words): Devastation of Lombard Street, goldsmiths saving ledgers, rebuilding 1666-1671, irony of surviving fire but not king's default
- ✅ Backwell's January 2-19, 1672 crisis (512 words): Learning of Stop, arithmetic of ruin (£295,994 owed), depositors demanding withdrawal, emergency Treasury meeting Jan 5-7, stripped of revenues Jan 19
- ✅ 28-year aftermath (543 words): Backwell's 10-year struggle, bankruptcy 1682, exile death 1683, Vyner's ruin, 3-year payment freeze, legal battles through three courts, 1701 settlement at 50% value, effective return 0.01% over 34 years
- ✅ Crypto parallel expansion (419 words): Terra/Luna collapse, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius (1.7M users), Voyager, BlockFi, FTX/Alameda using customer deposits, "not your keys" proving need for institutions

**Quality Metrics:**

- ✅ Contemporary relevance strong (2022 crypto cascade)
- ✅ Scholarly rigor maintained (all sourced)
- ✅ Narrative voice consistent

#### 🔄 Chapter 9: Gold Standard Victims (+1,973 words) - 66% Complete
**Baseline:** 2,675 → **Current:** 4,419 words (Target: 6,500)

- ✅ American Farmer A debt deflation (638 words): Iowa farmer, $90,000 debt at $2.00 corn → same debt required 5x more bushels at $0.41 corn, 1921-1927 borrowed from "banks, relatives, any sources," 1927-1928 foreclosure, 200,000 farms lost 1933
- ✅ France's five-year agony (493 words): Stayed on gold until Sept 1936 (5 years after Britain), industrial production fell 25%, Morvan Lebesque "winter on the streets...young men trying not to die," Léon Blum's belated devaluation, never recovered before WWII

**Remaining for Chapter 9:**
- ⏳ Expand Harry Todd story (+1,158 words): Add more Churchill causation chain, Keynes warnings, expand General Strike detail per original plan
- ⏳ Expand American Farmer (+562 words): Add methodology note about anonymization, strengthen connection to Fed/France gold sterilization

**Integration Work Done:**
- ✅ Removed Hugh Reynolds redundancy (streamlined -200 words)
- ✅ Added foreshadowing ("family would later describe as worse than WWII rationing")
- ✅ Explicit causation links throughout

#### ✅ Chapter 7: Bank Restriction Period (+1,081 words) - COMPLETE
**Baseline:** 4,263 → **Current:** 5,344 words

**Additions Made:**
- ✅ James Woodforde human story (493 words): Country rector in Norfolk using Bank notes 1797-1803, paying maidservant Betty Dade wages in notes, grumbling about Pitt's income tax but paying it, demonstrating ordinary acceptance of paper money far from London
- ✅ Expanded fiscal backing section (522 words): Made taxation-creates-demand mechanism explicit - Pitt's 1799 income tax required payment in Bank notes, creating guaranteed demand through closed-loop spending/taxation cycle, chartalism/state theory working in practice, quantitative evidence (£80-90M spending vs £60-65M revenue, 2.6x note expansion with only moderate inflation vs French assignats collapse), fiscal theory of price level anticipation
- ✅ "Twenty-four-year proof" section (66 words): Emphasized this wasn't temporary but a generation proving gold backing optional, systematic forgetting by creditor interests

**Quality Metrics:**
- ✅ Human story demonstrates ground-level paper money use
- ✅ Taxation mechanism made crystal clear (core thesis)
- ✅ Empirical proof emphasized (24 years without gold)
- ✅ Contemporary relevance maintained (2020 Fed expansion)

**Research Files Successfully Integrated:**
- ✅ `Britain's Currency Held Value for 24 Years Without Gold.md` (Woodforde diary, quantitative data, chartalism evidence)
