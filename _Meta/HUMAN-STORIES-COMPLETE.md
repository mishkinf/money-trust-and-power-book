## Incomplete Vignette

### ⏸️ VIGNETTE 5: Nixon Shock Family (Chapter 10)
**Status:** RESEARCH INCOMPLETE - archival access barriers

**Issue:** No individual or family could be located with verifiable contemporary documentation (diary entries, newspaper interviews from August 16-20, 1971, or letters) showing both immediate reaction and subsequent economic impact.

**Barrier:** Newspaper archives behind paywalls (ProQuest, newspapers.com), oral history collections not digitized, Library of Congress newspaper database only through 1963.

**Recommendation:** Either:
1. Conduct paid archival research through institutional library access
2. Substitute with Bank Restriction period vignette (1797-1821) which is well-documented
3. Use aggregate data about demographic impacts with proper framing

## Impact Assessment

### Reader Experience Improvement

**Before:** Abstract concepts explained through theory and statistics
**After:** Concrete human stories that readers will remember

**Memorable moments created:**
- Amat-Sîn and her daughter standing before the temple scribe, knowing the debt must be paid
- Datini sealing his letter with wax, sending paper promises across Europe
- Harman watching gold reserves evaporate, making the decision to lend when orthodoxy said restrict
- Attwood watching his workers starve, understanding what economists refused to see

### Pedagogical Value

Each vignette transforms abstract monetary concepts into tangible human experiences:

1. **Temple credit → Amat-Sîn's barley loan:** Shows obligations creating value, institutional power, debt enforcement
2. **Bills of exchange → Datini's transaction:** Shows merchant credit mechanics, usury prohibition workarounds, sovereign currency dependence
3. **Gold standard management → Harman's crisis:** Shows human judgment, lender of last resort doctrine, institutions over metal
4. **Intellectual suppression → Attwood's marginalization:** Shows manufactured orthodoxy, class interests, forgotten truths

### Historical Rigor

All vignettes use:
- Primary sources (tablets, archives, Parliamentary records)
- Specific dates and amounts
- Verifiable documentation
- Peer-reviewed publications or authoritative historical sources

This maintains academic credibility while achieving trade book accessibility.
