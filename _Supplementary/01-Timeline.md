# Timeline: Five Millennia of Money
*From Temple Ledgers to Digital Currency*

---

## ANCIENT WORLD (3000 BCE – 600 BCE)

### ~3000 BCE: Temple Ledgers in Mesopotamia
Sumerian temples in Uruk record grain debts and credits on clay tablets. Money begins not as coins but as accounting—credit precedes commodity. Scribes measure value in shekels of silver by weight, though few ever touch the metal itself.

### ~2400 BCE: Debt Jubilees (*Amargi*)
Babylonian rulers periodically cancel debts to prevent social collapse. These "clean slate" proclamations reveal that early money was a political technology of control, not a spontaneous market medium.

### ~1200 BCE: Chinese Tribute Systems
Zhou Dynasty establishes elaborate registers of land rent and tribute, laying foundation for state-managed accounting that would persist for millennia.

### ~600 BCE: First Coined Money (Lydia)
Kingdom of Lydia strikes first standardized coins—electrum stamped with royal lion. Coinage emerges to bridge zones of unfamiliarity, allowing trade across political boundaries where credit instruments fail.

## MEDIEVAL PERIOD (1100 – 1600)

### ~1100: English Tally Sticks
Henry I's Exchequer begins using split hazel rods to record tax payments. Notched and split lengthwise, each tally creates matching records for debtor and creditor. Tallies circulate as payment and are redeemed for taxes—state-backed credit without paper.

### 1252: Florentine Gold Florin
Florence mints florin at 3.5 grams pure gold, never debased. Alongside Venice's ducat (1284), it becomes trusted international currency. Stable coins spread by market competition; debased currencies are shunned.

### 1300s: Italian Bills of Exchange
Medici, Bardi, and Peruzzi banking houses create bills of exchange—paper instruments allowing merchants to pay in distant cities without moving gold. Early credit networks parallel to physical coin.

## THE FINANCIAL REVOLUTION (1688 – 1750)

### 1688: Glorious Revolution
William III and Mary II take English throne under strengthened Parliament. Bill of Rights (1689) forbids Crown from suspending laws or levying taxes without parliamentary consent. Sovereignty shifts from monarch to Parliament.

### 1690: Commission of Public Accounts
Parliament creates oversight body and inserts appropriations into supply bills. Government spending becomes accountable to elected representatives, not royal discretion.

### 1694: Bank of England Founded
Parliament charters joint-stock Bank to lend £1.2 million to government at 8%. Critically, new taxes are earmarked to service debt. Investors confident loans backed by parliamentary taxation. England pioneers modern funded state bond.

### 1696: Great Recoinage
Parliament appoints Isaac Newton as Master of the Mint. Undertakes massive recoinage to restore debased silver currency.

### 1717: Accidental Gold Standard
Newton sets mint price of gold relative to silver too low for silver's market value. Silver flows out of Britain. Gold becomes de facto anchor of pound. Britain inadvertently creates gold standard that will spread globally.

## THE AGE OF GOLD (1797 – 1914)

### 1797: Bank Restriction Act
Facing Napoleonic invasion threat, Parliament suspends Bank of England's gold convertibility. Notes outstanding double gold reserves. "Restriction" lasts 24 years, proving paper money can function in wartime without metal backing.

### 1789–1797: French Assignats
Revolutionary France prints assignats backed by confiscated church lands. Initial 400 million livres swells to hyperinflation. By 1796 replaced at 30:1 ratio; France reverts to metallic money under Napoleon. Cautionary tale of unbacked paper in wartime.

### 1821: Return to Gold
Britain restores gold convertibility at pre-1797 parity. Demonstrates institutional credibility: 24 years of paper currency, then voluntary return to gold at original rate.

### 1870–1914: Classical Gold Standard
Major economies peg currencies to specified quantities of gold. Fixed exchange rates internationally. Trade imbalances self-correct via specie flows. Era of relative monetary stability but limited domestic policy flexibility.

## THE ERA OF UPHEAVAL (1914 – 1971)

### 1914: WWI Breaks Gold Standard
European powers suspend gold convertibility to finance war. Germany, France, Austria-Hungary abandon gold payments. Britain and U.S. initially maintain links but strain under deficits. Governments issue vast notes and debt, often at cost of inflation.

### 1920s: Weakened Gold Returns
Partial return to gold standard, but system undermined by war debts and economic instability.

### 1929–1933: Great Depression
Gold standard rigidity contributes to deflation spiral. Countries that leave gold earlier recover faster. System's inflexibility exposed during crisis.

### 1944: Bretton Woods Conference
Allied nations create new system: currencies pegged to U.S. dollar (±1%), dollar pegged to gold at $35/oz. IMF established to enforce rules. U.S. Federal Reserve manages dollar-gold link.

### 1958: Full Currency Convertibility
Bretton Woods currencies fully convertible. Dollar becomes reserve currency. International balances settled in dollars, only U.S. owes gold.

### 1971: Nixon Closes Gold Window
U.S. deficits and overseas dollar accumulation exceed U.S. gold reserves. President Nixon ends dollar-gold convertibility. Bretton Woods dismantled. By 1973, major currencies float.

## THE FIAT ERA (1971 – PRESENT)

### 1971–Present: Pure Fiat Currency
All major economies adopt fiat money—currency backed by government decree, not commodity. Central banks use interest rates, reserve requirements, and open-market operations to target price stability and growth.

### 1980s–1990s: Inflation Targeting
Central banks gain independence and adopt explicit inflation targets. Policy credibility replaces gold as nominal anchor.

### 2008: Global Financial Crisis
Central banks expand balance sheets dramatically, proving fiat flexibility. Quantitative easing demonstrates that modern money is ultimately about institutional credibility and fiscal capacity.

### 2020s: Digital Currency Experiments
Central banks explore CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies). Cryptocurrencies offer decentralized alternatives, but state-backed currencies remain dominant based on taxing power and institutional stability.

## THE THROUGH-LINE

Five thousand years of monetary evolution reveal one constant: money is not a thing but a relationship. From clay tablets to digital ledgers, value lies not in metal but in institutions capable of enforcing obligations. Gold was never the foundation—it was a convenient fiction that delayed our recognition that money has always been credit, always political, always dependent on trust.
