# Glossary of Monetary Terms

---

### **Amargi**
Ancient Sumerian term meaning "return to mother" or "freedom." Debt cancellation proclamations issued periodically by Mesopotamian rulers to prevent debt bondage and social collapse. Early evidence that money was a political technology requiring periodic resets to maintain stability.

### **Assignat**
Paper currency issued by revolutionary France (1789–1797), initially backed by confiscated church lands. Massive overissuance led to hyperinflation; replaced at 30:1 ratio. Cautionary example of fiat money without institutional discipline.

### **Bank Restriction Act (1797)**
British law suspending the Bank of England's obligation to redeem notes in gold during Napoleonic Wars. Lasted 24 years (1797–1821), proving paper money could function in wartime without metal backing if institutions remained credible.

### **Bills of Exchange**
Credit instruments used by merchants to settle debts in distant cities without moving gold. Pioneered by Italian banking families in medieval period; became backbone of 18th-19th century international trade when centered in London.

### **Bretton Woods System**
International monetary regime (1944–1971) that fixed exchange rates by pegging currencies to U.S. dollar (±1%) and dollar to gold ($35/oz). Collapsed when U.S. abandoned gold convertibility in 1971.

### **Central Bank**
Institution that manages a nation's currency, money supply, and monetary policy. Early examples include Sweden's Riksbank (1668), Bank of England (1694), and Banque de France (1800). Modern central banks typically have monopoly on currency issuance and act as lender of last resort.

### **Commodity Money**
Currency whose value derives from the material it contains (gold, silver, etc.). Contrasts with credit money or fiat money, whose value depends on institutional backing and acceptance.

### **Consols**
British government perpetual bonds (consolidated annuities) paying fixed interest indefinitely with no maturity date. Became benchmark for British government debt in 18th-19th centuries; low rates demonstrated Parliament's credibility as borrower.

### **Debasement**
Reducing precious metal content in coins while maintaining face value. Common practice of medieval and early modern monarchs facing fiscal pressure; typically destroyed currency credibility and led to inflation.

### **Fiat Money**
Currency not backed by physical commodity; derives value from government decree and institutional credibility. All major currencies have been pure fiat since 1971. From Latin *fiat* ("let it be done").

### **Financial Revolution**
Term for England's late 17th-century transformation of public finance following Glorious Revolution (1688). Parliament gained control of taxation and borrowing, created Bank of England (1694), and established funded public debt backed by parliamentary taxes.

### **Florin**
Gold coin first minted by Florence in 1252 at 3.5 grams pure gold. Never debased; became trusted international currency alongside Venetian ducat. Example of how stable currencies spread through market competition.

### **Gold Standard**
Monetary system where currency value is defined by fixed weight of gold; paper money freely convertible to gold at that rate. Classical gold standard (1870–1914) featured automatic adjustment of trade imbalances through specie flows. Provided long-run price stability but limited domestic policy flexibility.

### **Glorious Revolution (1688)**
Overthrow of English King James II by Parliament, installing William III and Mary II under constitutional constraints. Shifted sovereignty from monarch to Parliament, transformed public finance by tying royal borrowing to parliamentary taxation.

### **Lender of Last Resort**
Central bank function of providing emergency liquidity to financial institutions during crises. Prevents bank runs from becoming systemic failures; key feature distinguishing central banks from earlier banking arrangements.

### **Mint Ratio**
Official price at which mint exchanges gold for silver (or vice versa). Isaac Newton's 1717 undervaluation of silver relative to gold accidentally drove silver from circulation and placed Britain on gold standard.

### **Open Market Operations**
Central bank buying/selling of government securities to influence money supply and interest rates. Primary tool of modern monetary policy under fiat currency regime.

### **Parliamentary Sovereignty**
Principle that Parliament is supreme lawmaking authority. In British context, established by Glorious Revolution; crucial for credible public debt because lenders knew Parliament controlled taxation.

### **Reserve Ratio**
Fraction of deposits that banks must hold as reserves (cash or central bank deposits). Tool for controlling money supply; higher ratios constrain credit creation.

### **Seigniorage**
Profit from issuing currency—difference between face value and production cost. Historically a revenue source for sovereigns; under fiat money, represents government's ability to create purchasing power through money creation.

### **Specie**
Coined money made of precious metal (gold or silver). Under gold standard, "specie flows" between countries automatically adjusted trade imbalances as metal moved to settle accounts.

### **Tally Sticks**
Split wooden rods used by English Exchequer (from ~1100) to record tax payments and loans. Each stick notched to show amount and split lengthwise; debtor and creditor each held matching piece. Could circulate as state-backed credit instrument.

### **Taxation-Driven Money**
Concept (prominent in Modern Monetary Theory) that fiat currency derives value from government's requirement that taxes be paid in it. Creates baseline demand independent of currency's intrinsic worth; explains how domestic credit instruments like tally sticks maintained value.

### **Temple Ledgers**
Clay tablets used by ancient Mesopotamian temples and palaces to record grain debts and credits. Earliest form of money-as-accounting; demonstrates credit preceded commodity money by millennia.

### **Unit of Account**
Function of money as standard measure of value. Can exist independently of physical medium; ancient societies measured value in silver shekels by weight long before coinage.
