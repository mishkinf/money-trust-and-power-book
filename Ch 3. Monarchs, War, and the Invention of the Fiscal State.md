# Monarchs, War, and the Invention of the Fiscal State

From the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries, European monarchs faced a paradox: they ruled increasingly ambitious realms but lacked the financial machinery to sustain them. Feudal dues and royal domains could pay for a coronation or a local skirmish—but not for the new reality of gunpowder warfare and standing armies. As the historian John Brewer later put it, “war was the driving force behind the modern state.”
The transition from medieval kingship to early modern statehood was fundamentally about finding ways to fund war. The key innovation was the fiscal state—a government able to extract taxes on a national scale and borrow against its own future revenues.
In early modern England, as across Europe, the costs were staggering. Maintaining a navy, building fortifications, and hiring professional soldiers required liquid money, not in-kind tribute. Metal coin alone could not meet that demand; there simply wasn’t enough gold or silver in circulation. Thus, kings turned increasingly to credit—borrowing from merchants, goldsmiths, and financiers who had become accustomed to the instruments of international trade.
Yet this dependence on private lenders created a crisis of trust. Under the Tudors and early Stuarts, the English Crown routinely defaulted or delayed repayment. When King Charles I needed money for his wars against Spain and France, he resorted to forced loans and arbitrary seizures. His absolutist methods provoked outrage and eventually civil war. When he was executed in 1649, it symbolized not just a political upheaval but a financial one: the old idea of the king as the sole sovereign of credit was breaking down.
The restored Stuart monarchy (Charles II and James II) learned little from that lesson. In 1672, Charles II infamously declared the “Stop of the Exchequer”, suspending payments on royal debt to London’s goldsmith-bankers. It was a catastrophe for trust in the Crown. Merchants who had lent to the government in good faith found themselves ruined. From that moment, the City of London’s financiers resolved that no future loans would be made without institutional guarantees.
The king could raise armies, but he could not raise credit. And without credit, he could not raise armies. That circular trap set the stage for the revolution of 1688 and the new partnership between Parliament and finance that would define the modern world.
