# Collapse, Bretton Woods, and the Fiat Era

By the early 20th century, the classical gold standard had created a tightly interconnected global economy — but also an inherently fragile one. The same mechanisms that had underpinned Victorian stability became sources of rigidity in an industrialized, democratic, and increasingly debt-driven world. Gold could no longer expand in step with production, trade, or the fiscal needs of modern states.

The First World War shattered the illusion of permanence. To fund total war, governments suspended convertibility and printed vast quantities of money. Britain’s national debt multiplied tenfold; Germany and Austria resorted to outright monetization. The “discipline of gold” evaporated overnight, replaced by the more pressing discipline of survival. Yet when the war ended, elites tried to turn back the clock.

#### The Interwar Gold Standard: Discipline Without Trust

In the 1920s, under Treasury official Winston Churchill, Britain returned to gold at the pre-war parity of £3 17s 10½d per ounce — a nostalgic gesture to imperial greatness. But the world had changed. Prices and wages were far higher than before, meaning that restoring gold at the old rate made British exports uncompetitive and domestic unemployment severe.
Meanwhile, the United States and France hoarded massive gold reserves, drawing metal out of circulation and creating global deflation. The automatic balancing mechanism that had once stabilized trade now worked in reverse: surplus nations sterilized their inflows, while deficit nations endured brutal contractions. In effect, gold had become a weapon of austerity.
From an institutional standpoint, the interwar gold standard was paradoxical. It promised a self-regulating system, but in practice required political cooperation that no one could sustain. Countries that adhered strictly to gold faced depression; those that abandoned it — like Britain in 1931 and the U.S. under Roosevelt in 1933 — recovered faster. Once again, the pattern repeated: confidence survived not through metal convertibility, but through credible political capacity to act.

#### Bretton Woods: A Managed Resurrection

The Second World War finally buried the old order. In 1944, as Allied victory neared, economists and statesmen gathered at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to design a postwar monetary framework that could combine stability with flexibility. The architect was John Maynard Keynes, who proposed a global clearing union using an international unit of account called the bancor. His vision was radical: world money without gold, managed through an institution that would credit or debit nations automatically according to their trade balances.
But the U.S., now holding more than two-thirds of the world’s gold, had other plans. American negotiator Harry Dexter White insisted on a dollar-centered system: the dollar would be convertible into gold at $35 per ounce, and all other currencies would peg to the dollar. This arrangement — a hybrid between a gold standard and a credit system — institutionalized U.S. monetary hegemony. Foreign central banks could hold dollar reserves instead of bullion, while the U.S. promised to redeem them in gold “on demand.”

In practice, the new system functioned much like Britain’s had a century earlier:
Domestic trust came from taxation and institutional credibility.
International confidence came from a gold promise backed by fiscal power.
 The U.S. Treasury financed postwar reconstruction through spending and lending — the Marshall Plan, foreign aid, and military outlays — creating global demand for dollars. Taxes and productivity sustained domestic confidence; the gold peg reassured the rest of the world.


#### The Nixon Shock: End of Convertibility

By the 1960s, however, the same contradiction reemerged. U.S. deficits mounted as the government financed both the Vietnam War and Great Society programs. Foreign holders of dollars — especially France — began demanding gold. But there wasn’t enough to cover all claims. The U.S. was the new Britain: its domestic credit far exceeded its metal reserves.
In August 1971, President Richard Nixon announced that the United States would “temporarily” suspend gold convertibility. It was the end of the Bretton Woods system. Within two years, currencies floated freely against each other for the first time in history. The world had moved, de facto and then de jure, into the fiat era — a system where money’s value rested entirely on trust in the issuing state, not on redemption in a commodity.

#### The Fiat Order: Trust Without Metal

Under fiat money, every major economy’s currency became what the pound had already been in practice since 1694: a liability of the state, created by keystroke or ledger entry, backed by the power to tax and the stability of institutions. The difference was now explicit — there was no gold curtain to hide behind.

Central banks emerged as the successors to the old metallic anchor. They no longer promised redemption in gold, but price stability, enforced through monetary policy. In MMT terms, this represented the full maturity of the system begun in the 17th century: governments “spend first” by crediting bank accounts, and taxation later withdraws that spending to preserve value. Bond sales serve to manage interest rates and liquidity, not to “finance” expenditures.
Internationally, the dollar retained its role as the world’s reserve asset — not because it was backed by gold, but because the U.S. economy, its tax base, and its institutional credibility remained unmatched. Trust had shifted from metal to governance.

#### The Enduring Pattern

Across centuries, the story repeats with remarkable consistency:
- Domestic trust arises from the state’s ability to impose taxes and enforce contracts.
- International trust arises from credible rules — once convertibility, now institutions and transparency.
- Money itself is an evolving social contract between governments, creditors, and citizens, mediated through accounting.

Gold provided discipline when institutions were weak. But as institutions matured, discipline became political, not metallic. What began in Babylon as temple ledgers and in medieval England as tally sticks has, through the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve, evolved into today’s digital fiat systems — all still grounded in the same ancient logic:
> Money is a promise sustained by trust, and trust is sustained by law and taxation.
