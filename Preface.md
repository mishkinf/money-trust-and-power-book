# Preface

> Money has always been more than a medium of exchange.
> It is a mirror of power, law, and collective belief.

This book traces the evolution of money from its origins as social credit to the global systems of fiat currency, exploring how taxation, institutions, and trust — not metal — sustain value. From temple ledgers and tally sticks to the Bank of England and modern central banks, it reveals how every financial revolution was ultimately a political one.

To understand money is to understand sovereignty, and to see how societies choose to organize their mutual obligations. This is the story of how we learned — again and again — that value does not lie in gold, but in trust.
