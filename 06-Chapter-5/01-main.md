# The Alchemy of Paper: How Money Creation Actually Worked

The clerk's quill scratched across the ledger in the Bank of England's accounting room. It was a Tuesday morning in March 1697, and he was recording a transaction that would have baffled his grandfather: the government had just spent £50,000 that did not exist three days earlier. No gold had entered the Bank's vaults. No merchant had deposited coin. Yet the money was real—circulating through London's markets, paying soldiers' wages, and settling debts. The clerk understood what many outside the Bank did not: **money was not a thing but a relationship**, recorded in double-entry ledgers and backed by the government's power to tax.¹

This was the revolution that the Bank of England had quietly accomplished. It had not discovered a new source of wealth or unlocked some hidden reserve of gold. It had **invented a machine for creating purchasing power**—a system that turned promises into money by making those promises credible. The machine's fuel was not metal but **obligation**: the government's legal power to demand payment, and the public's legal duty to provide it.²

### The mechanics of creation

When the Bank lent to the government, it did not hand over sacks of gold. It created an entry in its books. On the asset side of the ledger: "Loan to Government, £X." On the liability side: "Banknotes Issued, £X." The notes were printed, signed by the Bank's cashiers, and delivered to the Exchequer. When the government spent them—paying a shipbuilder in Portsmouth, a grain merchant in Norfolk, or a Dutch ally's subsidy—those notes entered circulation as **money**.³

The shipbuilder accepted the note because he knew three things:

1. **The Bank would redeem it** for gold coin if he demanded it.
2. **Other merchants would accept it** because they knew the same.
3. **The government would accept it** for taxes, rents, and fees.

The third point was crucial. A Bank of England note was not just a promise to pay gold; it was a **tax credit**—a portable claim on the government's future revenue. Anyone who owed taxes could discharge that obligation with a Bank note. This created a baseline demand that had nothing to do with the note's convertibility into metal. Even if the Bank's vaults were empty, the note would retain value as long as the government collected taxes and accepted its own paper.⁴

This was the same principle that had made Mesopotamian grain credits and English tally sticks valuable: the issuing authority's power to demand them back. But the Bank had refined the mechanism. Where tally sticks circulated clumsily—notched wood that had to be physically matched—Bank notes were uniform, portable, and divisible. They were **industrial-scale credit**, mass-produced and standardized.⁵

### The double-entry revolution

By the 1780s, the Bank employed approximately **300 clerks** to maintain its ledgers—five times more than the Treasury. These men worked in shifts, recording every transaction in duplicate: one entry for the Bank's records, another for the customer's account. The system was exhaustive and exhausting. A single loan to the government might generate dozens of entries as the money moved through the economy, returned to the Bank as deposits, and was lent out again.⁶

The ledgers revealed something that contemporaries struggled to articulate: **the same money could exist in multiple places simultaneously**. When the government spent a Bank note and the recipient deposited it back at the Bank, the note disappeared from circulation—but the money did not. The Bank recorded a new liability (the deposit) and could lend against it, creating a fresh note. The original government loan remained on the books; the new note represented additional purchasing power. Money had **multiplied** through the act of lending and re-depositing.⁷

This was not fraud or sleight of hand. It was the natural consequence of treating money as **credit** rather than commodity. Most people think banks work like coat-check rooms: you deposit your coat, they give you a ticket, and they lend your coat to someone else while you are not using it. This is wrong. Banks work like scoreboards. When a bank makes a loan, it does not hand over depositors' money—it creates a new deposit by writing numbers in an account. If you borrow £1,000, the bank writes "+£1,000" in your account and "+£1,000 loan" on its books. New money appeared from nowhere, created by the act of lending. The constraint is not how much money the bank has—it is whether you will repay the loan and whether other people trust the bank's numbers.

A goldsmith who accepted deposits and lent them out was merely intermediating: moving existing wealth from saver to borrower. But a bank that issued its own notes was doing something different: it was **creating new claims** on future production, backed by the borrower's promise to repay and the government's promise to tax. Banks do not lend money; they **create it by lending**.⁸

The limit was not the gold in the vault but **confidence**. As long as most people preferred the convenience of paper to the security of metal, the Bank could issue far more notes than it held in specie. The reserve ratio—gold to notes outstanding—fluctuated between 10 and 40 percent, depending on the season, the state of trade, and the proximity of war. In peacetime, the ratio could fall safely; in crisis, it had to rise or the Bank risked a run.⁹

### Why taxation made it work domestically

The Bank's notes circulated in England because **everyone eventually owed the government something**. Taxes were the universal obligation. A farmer in Yorkshire might never visit London or see the Bank's marble halls, but he paid land tax every year. A merchant in Bristol paid customs duties on imported wine. A gentleman in Bath paid window tax on his townhouse. All these obligations could be satisfied with Bank of England notes.¹⁰

This created a perpetual cycle:

1. **The government spent** Bank notes into the economy (paying soldiers, suppliers, contractors).
2. **The notes circulated** through private transactions (wages, purchases, loans).
3. **Taxation withdrew** notes from circulation (as subjects paid their obligations).
4. **The government spent again**, reinjecting the notes.

The cycle was self-sustaining. The government did not need to hoard gold to create money; it needed only to **spend first and tax later**. The spending created the money; the taxation ensured demand for it. As long as the government could enforce tax collection, its paper would hold value.¹¹

This was the insight that would later be formalized as the **tax-driven money theory**: a sovereign government that issues its own currency and requires taxes be paid in that currency creates demand for the currency by fiat. The value derives not from the paper or the ink but from the **legal obligation** to use it in dealings with the state.¹²

The principle was not new. Adam Smith had articulated it in *The Wealth of Nations* (1776), writing that "a prince, who should enact that a certain proportion of his taxes should be paid in a paper money of a certain kind, might thereby give a certain value to this paper money; even though the term of its final discharge and redemption should depend altogether on the will of the prince." Smith understood that state-imposed tax obligations could create demand for otherwise worthless fiat currency—a recognition that anticipated modern monetary theory by two centuries.¹²ᵃ

Imagine you are a farmer in 1700s England. You grow wheat, raise sheep, make your own clothes. You could live entirely without money—except for one thing: the tax collector comes every year demanding £5 in Bank of England notes. Not wheat, not sheep, not labor—specifically those paper notes. Suddenly you **need** those notes. You must sell something for notes, or work for someone who pays in notes, or borrow notes. The government created demand for its paper by requiring you to pay taxes with it. This is why tally sticks worked in England but were worthless in France—English tax collectors accepted them, French ones did not. **Taxation is what makes paper valuable**, not the paper itself.

In practice, this meant that England's money supply was **elastic**. When the government needed to finance a war, the Bank could expand note issuance. When peace returned and spending fell, taxation would contract the supply. The system was self-regulating, limited only by the government's ability to tax and the public's willingness to hold paper rather than demand gold.¹³

### The two-tier system: base money and bank credit

Yet the Bank of England's notes were only part of England's money supply—and not even the largest part. By the early 1700s, a parallel system had emerged spontaneously across provincial England: **country banks** issuing their own paper currency. These were not branches of the Bank of England but independent private partnerships—wool merchants in Somerset, ironmasters in Birmingham, cloth traders in Manchester—who discovered they could issue promissory notes that circulated as money in their local communities.¹³ᵃ

The proliferation was extraordinary. By 1784, over 100 country banks operated. By 1793, over 300. **By 1810, more than 700 banks issued approximately £22 million in notes**—compared to the Bank of England's smaller circulation. During the Napoleonic Wars suspension period (1797-1821), when gold convertibility was suspended, country bank notes represented **the bulk of England's circulating money supply**. One assessment found that in the early 1830s, country banks still issued around **60 percent of all banknotes in England**, with the Bank of England providing only 40 percent.¹³ᵇ

How was this possible? The answer reveals a critical truth about money creation: **private banks created money without government permission**. No law authorized country banks to issue notes. No charter granted them privileges. No regulatory body supervised their operations. They emerged through commercial freedom—the common law principle that what Parliament did not prohibit was permitted. The 1708 Bank of England Act had prohibited partnerships of more than six persons from banking (protecting the Bank's monopoly on joint-stock organization), but it left small partnerships free to operate. Hundreds of merchant-bankers simply began printing their own notes, and their communities accepted them.¹³ᶜ

Thomas Fox, a wool manufacturer in Wellington, Somerset, illustrates the pattern. In October 1787, Fox found transporting cash to pay sheep farmers dangerous and inconvenient. His father-in-law, a London banker, suggested establishing a local bank. Fox accumulated capital from his textile business, designed notes promising to pay bearers on demand, hired printers, and issued the first notes. No government approval preceded or followed this. The bank's credibility derived entirely from Fox's fifty-year reputation as a successful manufacturer and from the unlimited personal liability of partners whose entire fortunes backed the notes.¹³ᵈ

But here is the crucial point: **country bank notes derived their value from convertibility into Bank of England notes, which alone could pay taxes**. This created a hierarchy:

**Tier 1**: Bank of England notes (accepted by Exchequer for tax payments)  
**Tier 2**: Country bank notes (convertible to Bank of England notes on demand)  
**Tier 3**: Gold coin (Bank of England notes convertible to gold)

The Exchequer accepted Bank of England notes for tax payments but not country bank notes. This wasn't a technicality—it was the foundational distinction between state-backed money and private substitutes. A Lancashire merchant might accept Manchester bank notes for wool, but when tax day arrived, those notes had to be converted into Bank of England money. Country banks held correspondent relationships with London banks, which in turn held accounts at the Bank of England. Payments moved up and down this pyramid, with Bank of England reserves serving as the settlement medium.¹³ᵉ

The system worked through **pyramiding**: country banks held Bank of England notes as reserves and issued their own notes on top of them, typically at ratios of 3:1 or 4:1. When a customer deposited gold at a country bank, the bank might keep some gold locally but send most to its London correspondent, receiving Bank of England notes in return. The country bank then issued its own notes against these reserves, multiplying the money supply. The entire structure rested on the foundation of Bank of England money, which derived its value from tax acceptability.¹³ᶠ

This two-tier system did not contradict the principle that taxation drives money demand—it **proved** it. Country bank notes circulated precisely because they were convertible into Bank of England notes, which alone could discharge tax obligations. When country banks suspended convertibility during crises, their notes collapsed in value or traded at steep discounts. The hierarchy wasn't theoretical; it was functional, enforced daily through interbank settlement and the state's monopoly on legal tender designation. Bank of England notes received legal tender status in 1833, while country bank notes never achieved this privilege.¹³ᵍ

The geographic spread was comprehensive. Every industrial city—Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle, Liverpool—had multiple note-issuing banks. Each operated within local networks, accepting notes from partner banks while rejecting distant issuers. This created fragmented monetary zones where Birmingham notes might trade at par in nearby towns but at discounts further away. Yet underneath this apparent decentralization lay the critical foundation: country banks increasingly held Bank of England notes as reserves, and the Bank's notes were valuable because the government accepted them for taxes.¹³ʰ

What England had created, without fully understanding it, was the prototype of the modern monetary system: **central bank base money supporting commercial bank credit creation**. The Bank of England provided the foundation—the reserves, the settlement medium, the money accepted for taxes. Country banks provided the superstructure—the credit expansion, the local currency, the financing for industrial growth. Most circulating money was private bank credit, yet this private money rested entirely on a public foundation. The principle that would later be formalized as the "hierarchy of money" was already operating in Georgian England, visible to anyone who traced how payments actually settled.¹³ⁱ

### Why foreigners trusted it

But domestic circulation was only half the story. For England to borrow abroad—to finance wars in Europe, subsidize allies, or purchase foreign goods—its promises had to be credible to people who did not owe English taxes. A Dutch banker or a Hamburg merchant had no obligation to the Exchequer. Why would they accept English paper or lend to the English government?¹⁴

The answer was **parliamentary taxation**. Foreign creditors understood that England's ability to repay depended on its ability to tax. And because Parliament—not the king—controlled taxation, creditors could trust that taxes would actually be collected and allocated to debt service. The Bill of Rights (1689) had made explicit what the Civil War had implied: the crown could not suspend Parliament, and Parliament controlled the purse.¹⁵

This constitutional settlement transformed England's credit. Before 1688, lending to the English crown was a gamble on royal virtue. After 1688, it was a bet on parliamentary capacity. And because Parliament represented the propertied classes—the very people who paid most taxes—it had every incentive to honor debts. Default would mean taxing themselves to cover losses.¹⁶

Foreign lenders did not need to hold Bank notes or care about their domestic circulation. They cared about England's ability to **convert** paper into gold or goods when needed. And that ability rested on two pillars:

1. **Tax revenue** sufficient to service debt and maintain gold reserves.
2. **Trade surpluses** that brought gold into the country.

As long as England could tax its subjects and sell more abroad than it bought, it could accumulate the gold needed to satisfy foreign creditors. The Bank's domestic note issuance was irrelevant to this calculation. What mattered was the **fiscal capacity** of the state—its power to extract resources from the economy and direct them toward public purposes.¹⁷

---

### The implicit bargain

The system rested on an implicit bargain between three parties: the government, the Bank, and the taxpaying public. Each had something the others needed:

- **The government** needed liquidity to finance wars and operations. It could not wait for tax revenues to trickle in; it needed to spend immediately.
- **The Bank** needed a monopoly charter and legal privileges. It could not issue notes without government sanction, and it could not enforce contracts without state power.
- **The public** needed a stable medium of exchange. Gold and silver were scarce and inconvenient; paper was abundant and portable.

The bargain worked because each party's interests aligned. The government granted the Bank monopoly power in exchange for cheap credit. The Bank created money by lending to the government, earning interest on the spread between what it paid depositors (nothing, for notes) and what it charged the government (8 percent, later reduced to 3 percent). The public accepted paper because it was more convenient than metal and because the government's taxing power guaranteed demand.¹⁸

But the bargain was fragile. If the government spent recklessly, inflation would erode the value of paper, and the public would demand gold. If the Bank lent too freely, a crisis of confidence could trigger a run. If Parliament failed to collect taxes, the entire system would collapse. The machine worked only as long as all three parties maintained **discipline**.¹⁹

---

### The limits of creation

The Bank's power to create money was not unlimited. It faced three constraints:

**1. Convertibility**: The Bank had promised to redeem its notes for gold on demand. If too many people demanded redemption simultaneously, the Bank would exhaust its reserves and fail. This was the nightmare scenario—a **bank run** that would destroy confidence in paper money and force a return to metallic currency.²⁰

**2. Inflation**: If the Bank issued too many notes relative to the economy's productive capacity, prices would rise. Inflation was not yet well understood in the 1690s, but merchants knew that when money was abundant, goods became expensive. Persistent inflation would drive people to demand gold, undermining the Bank's ability to maintain convertibility.²¹

**3. Parliamentary approval**: The Bank could not lend to the government without Parliament's consent. Every loan required a statute specifying the terms, the interest rate, and the taxes earmarked for repayment. This was the constitutional check on money creation: the Bank could not simply print notes and hand them to the king. It needed legislative authorization.²²

These constraints meant that money creation was **endogenous**—determined by the interaction of the Bank's lending decisions, the government's spending needs, and the public's demand for liquidity. The Bank could not arbitrarily expand the money supply; it could only respond to demand for credit. And that demand was shaped by the real economy: trade, production, and the fiscal needs of the state.²³

### The paradox of paper

By the early 18th century, England had achieved something unprecedented: a monetary system based almost entirely on **credit** rather than commodity. The Bank's notes circulated as freely as gold coin, and in many transactions they were preferred. Merchants found paper easier to transport and count; the government found it easier to manage large payments. Even foreign trade increasingly settled in bills of exchange rather than bullion shipments.²⁴

Yet the system depended on the **illusion of convertibility**. The Bank held far less gold than it had notes outstanding, but as long as most people did not demand redemption, the illusion held. It was a collective fiction, sustained by mutual trust: the public trusted the Bank, the Bank trusted the government, and the government trusted Parliament's ability to tax.²⁵

The system was like a bridge held up by collective belief. As long as everyone walked across confidently, the structure held firm. But if everyone stopped simultaneously to test its strength—to demand gold and verify the Bank's reserves—the bridge would collapse under the weight of scrutiny. The paradox was that the system worked precisely because **most people did not test it**. If everyone simultaneously demanded gold, the system would collapse. But as long as people accepted paper—because it was convenient, because others accepted it, because the government required it for taxes—the system was stable. Money was valuable because people believed it was valuable, and they believed it was valuable because the institutions backing it were credible.²⁶

The Bank of England had not abolished the need for gold; it had **subordinated** gold to a more fundamental source of value: the state's power to tax and the public's obligation to pay. Gold remained important as a reserve, a backstop, and a means of international settlement. But domestically, the real anchor was not metal but **law**—the legal framework that bound government, Bank, and citizens into a system of mutual obligation.²⁷

### The lesson for the future

What England discovered in the 1690s would take centuries to fully articulate: **money is a creature of the state, not the market**. It emerges not from barter or commodity exchange but from the legal power to impose obligations and the institutional capacity to enforce them. Gold and silver had value because states accepted them for taxes; paper had value for the same reason. The medium mattered less than the **authority** behind it.²⁸

This insight would be forgotten and rediscovered repeatedly over the next three centuries. Every financial crisis would prompt calls to "return to sound money"—to gold, to silver, to some tangible anchor. But the lesson of the Bank of England was that **sound money is institutional money**: money backed by credible promises, enforced by law, and sustained by the state's fiscal capacity.²⁹

The Bank's clerks, scratching entries in their ledgers, understood this intuitively. They were not recording the movement of gold but the creation of **obligations**—promises to pay, backed by the government's power to tax and the Bank's monopoly on note issuance. The ledgers were the money; the notes were merely its portable form. And as long as the ledgers balanced, the system worked.³⁰

By 1700, England had built a financial machine that would power its rise to global dominance. It was not the richest country in Europe—France had more people, Spain had more gold, the Dutch had more trade. But England had something more valuable: a **credible system** for turning future tax revenues into present purchasing power. It could borrow more, at lower rates, than any rival. And that advantage would prove decisive in the wars to come.³¹

But this domestic alchemy—taxation creating demand for paper money, the Bank creating money by lending—would face its greatest test when war forced Britain to choose between gold and survival. In 1797, that choice would arrive. French troops would land in Wales, panic would grip London, and the Bank's gold reserves would drain away. The government would face a decision that seemed impossible: suspend gold convertibility and risk destroying the currency, or maintain convertibility and watch the Bank fail. What happened next would prove that the system's foundation was not gold but trust—and that trust, properly earned, could survive even the loss of metal backing.

### **Chapter Summary**

The Bank of England created money through a revolutionary mechanism: lending to government by issuing banknotes that circulated as currency. When the Bank lent £1.2 million, it didn't hand over gold—it created notes backed by the government loan. These notes had value domestically because taxation created demand: anyone owing taxes could pay in Bank notes, guaranteeing baseline circulation. The government spent notes into the economy; taxation withdrew them, controlling supply. This closed loop—Bank creates money, government spends it, taxation validates it—made paper function as well as gold within England's borders. Foreign creditors accepted this arrangement because parliamentary taxation demonstrated fiscal capacity to convert notes to gold when needed. The system had three constraints: convertibility (gold reserves limited note issuance), inflation (excess notes raised prices), and parliamentary approval (every loan required legislative authorization). Money creation was endogenous—determined by real economic demand, not arbitrary printing. The insight: money is a creature of the state, backed by legal authority and fiscal capacity, not commodity value. Sound money is institutional money.
